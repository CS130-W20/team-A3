    Returns name and link to courses to recommend to a specific user.

    Connects to user_interest, user_knowledge, and course_concepts tables
    and uses the vector representations of each to find courses which a user may
    be interested in (course covers many user interests) as well as matches
    background of user (user has background knowledge to complete course).

    Parameters:
    user_id (int): ID of user

    Returns:

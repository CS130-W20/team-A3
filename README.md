# EducationAI

> EduAI, a website to help people learn and explore MOOCs in a more efficient way. 

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

Our application will have two primary novel features:
1) Features for exploring MOOCs based on knowledge concept dependencies. 
2) Personalized learning. Learners have various backgrounds, and traditional platforms ignore this diversity by suggesting the same courses for every learner.

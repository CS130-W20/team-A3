Instead of merely explaining the science, we help you build on that foundation in a practical manner, with an emphasis on the hands-on implementation of those ideas in the Python programming language. In this course, we cover the estimation, of risk and return parameters for meaningful portfolio decisions, and also introduce a variety of state-of-the-art portfolio construction techniques that have proven popular in investment management and portfolio construction due to their enhanced robustness.

As we cover the theory and math in lecture videos, we'll also implement the concepts in Python, and you'll be able to code along with us so that you have a deep and practical understanding of how those methods work. By the time you are done, not only will you have a foundational understanding of modern computational methods in investment management, you'll have practical mastery in the implementation of those methods. If you follow along and implement all the lab exercises, you will complete the course with a powerful toolkit that you will be able to use to perform your own analysis and build your own implementations and perhaps even use your newly acquired knowledge to improve on current methods.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Business.Finance</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>EDHEC Business School</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Style &amp; Factors//Robust estimates for the covariance matrix//Robust estimates for expected returns//Portfolio Optimization in Practice</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome video', 'Introduction to factor investing', 'Factor models and the CAPM', 'Multi-Factor models and Fama-French', 'Factor benchmarks and Style analysis', 'Shortcomings of cap-weighted indices', 'From cap-weighted benchmarks to smart-weighted benchmarks', 'Introduction to Lab sessions', 'Module 1 Lab Session - Foundations'], ['The curse of dimensionality', 'Estimating the Covariance Matrix with a Factor Model', 'Honey I Shrunk the Covariance Matrix!', 'Portfolio Construction with Time-Varying Risk Parameters', 'Exponentially weighted average', 'ARCH and GARCH Models', 'Module 2 Lab Session - Covariance Estimation'], ['Lack of Robustness of Expected Return Estimates', 'Agnostic Priors on Expected Return Estimates', 'Using Factor Models to Estimate Expected Returns', 'Extracting Implied Expected Returns', 'Introducing Active Views', 'Black-Litterman Analysis', 'Module 3 Lab Session- Black Litterman'], ['Naive Diversification', 'Scientific Diversification', 'Measuring risk contributions', 'Simplified risk parity portfolios', 'Risk Parity Portfolios', 'Comparing Diversification Options', 'Module 4 Lab Session - Risk Contribution and Risk Parity']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 11 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

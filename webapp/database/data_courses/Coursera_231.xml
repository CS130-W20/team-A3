She tried to present it systematically with enough information to give students the ability to perform the programming tasks.  There were, however, a number of areas where there is substantial room for improvement.\n', "This is a very poorly designed and executed course. The teacher should have used a bit more practical examples and the video lengths is too long. I have to leave it halfway, because I don't see any point of wasting my time with it. Its sad that this is part of such a great specialization module. I hope the user comments allow the course designers to implement some changes to this course. ", 'Detailed and challenging. ', 'I really love this course. It changed my life', 'It was a quite challenging experience, especially the final module. The problem you have to deal with is not "how to properly use the programs/tools", instead, we have to learn "how to play with the parameters" so that we can have the right answers for the quiz/exam questions. There were a lot of failures throughout this course, I had to watch the lectures again and again, deeply dive into the discussions in course forum, search google and seqsanswer/biostar forum, etc.... I became hating the lecturer and the mentors for theirs not so well organized lectures and answers ... But afterall, I\'ve learned a lot. Thank you!', 'Excellent course. Thanks :)', '\n', 'Clear, very practical and applicable', "The course content is very solid. It focuses heavily on the tools and technique, and there lacks the concepts and biology behind those tools. But I would guess there is some prior courses in this specialization explaining the concepts, though I didn't take them.", 'very basic and useful command line tools for genomic data analysis. ', 'Simple, straight forward and  descriptive', 'very information with hands on training exercises.', "Learned a lot in this course. Very useful if you want to do NGS analysis. Week2 and Week4 were too vast. Flowcharts would be useful to know in which step we are in the analysis. VM didn't work for me. I installed all the tools on my machine to finish the assignments. ", 'the best course i have ever ever taken.', 'I have learnt so much from this course. ', 'Very interesting and detailed course.', 'Very detailed and simply explained introduction to work in linux environment for biologist', 'It is easy to learn the basic knowledge,And It is very useful', 'thank you for the course!', None, 'A really hard introduction to bioinformatics pipelines, it was difficult but was stimulant!', 'I learned a LOT from this class and the instructor is very clear.', 'Very informative course. Because I am new to this, it was at times \nconfusing. But overall, great teaching and great experience. Thank you.', 'This is perhaps one of the most clearly taught courses I have had on Coursera. Thank you for putting in time to teach us!', "Thank you very much Dr./Professor, Liliana Florea. I've learned a lot. It's a very good opportunity to improve my knowledge.

It provides a quick overview of the Google Cloud Platform and a deeper dive of the data processing capabilities.

At the end of this course, participants will be able to:
• Identify the purpose and value of the key Big Data and Machine Learning products in the Google Cloud Platform
• Use CloudSQL and Cloud Dataproc to migrate existing MySQL and Hadoop/Pig/Spark/Hive workloads to Google Cloud Platform
• Employ BigQuery and Cloud Datalab to carry out interactive data analysis
• Choose between Cloud SQL, BigTable and Datastore
• Train and use a neural network using TensorFlow
• Choose between different data processing products on the Google Cloud Platform

Before enrolling in this course, participants should have roughly one (1) year of experience with one or more of the following:
• A common query language such as SQL
• Extract, transform, load activities
• Data modeling
• Machine learning and/or statistics
• Programming in Python

In particular, any labs that required me to open ungit in Datalab would hang for extended periods of time or fail altogether. I would have to reload or reopen the Datalab pages multiple times just to be able to click to the next section. These assignments are timed. The amount of time wasted was not critical to my project success, but they were very frustrating to complete.', 'It felt a bit long in some places but I appreciate the breadth of information being squeezed in a small time frame. The qwik labs and datalab notebooks were great to learn some things by trying them out. I think it would be even better if there was a task to create a simple notebook from scratch - that is something that I will need to do to continue learning.', 'This course provides the basics of Google Cloud Platform and makes us understand Google Products and services on Cloud. I would love to explore GCP more and will opt for the remaining GCP courses.', 'This was a great course to understand at a high level how to design and create my data ecosystem and how to do it sustainably. Hopefully, next courses provide more in-depth the technical features.', 'Very Basic course.. But helpful to get started with GCP', 'good learning', 'Good course for a data engineer', 'Awesome!', 'Excellent Structure of the materials, and labs', "Ce cours permet bien d'identifier les solutions Google pour chaque besoin en traitement des données", 'This is very informative course of Google Cloud Platform. Its a very well curated course and its a heaven for data engineers.', 'Excellent Course materials and Mentors. Thanks Coursera! ', 'Awesome flow.', 'A good basic insight into what is available on the Google Cloud Platform. ', 'Amazing introduction to GCP. Coming from AWS, I was amazed by its lack of friction!', 'it was great. i found the labs redundant a bit though.', 'Good learning', 'Its best Way to travel cloud world ......... Amazing experience, easy to understand and deployment tool provided by google.  google proved his words "No operation"   ', 'Muy buenos para entrar en las herramientas gcp, los laboratorios ayudan mucho, pero son muy simples.', 'Very fast, but very interesting', 'A course which is must to be done by a beginner who like to come to the cloud world as a beginner. Very interesting sessions mixed up with hands-on labs will give you a lots of confidence to make experiment on GCP without any other tutorials. Almost all the products and technologies are well explained not only the concepts but the actual real world scenario where we can suggest and implement the GCP tools. This course extremely boosted my confidence to go for my next goal which is to become a Google certified Professional Data Engineer.', 'This is great !!! Thank You', "Great course for a people who want to know the overview about Google Cloud's product that specified on the Data Engineering fields. Very straight forward instructions and clear concepts.", 'Though it is the fundamental course or the introduction  course, it helps me to understand what cloud platform could do for analytics']</reviews><reviewers>['By Abhimanyu R', 'By Emem M', 'By Peter B', 'By Dileep K', 'By CHRISTIAN R F R', 'By Hanumantha R V', 'By Abhijit B N', 'By Rita Y', 'By Angel D', 'By el a s', 'By Benoit L', 'By Sarthak K S', 'By selvaraj s', 'By Muthu M H', 'By Patrick B', 'By Bethany B', 'By Jesse S', 'By Raja R G', 'By RAJESH A J', 'By Jordan E V R', 'By Peter S', 'By Jineesh M', 'By Jogender S', 'By Muhammad U S', 'By Yidong Z']</reviewers><review_date>['Jan 31, 2019', 'Jan 13, 2019', 'Jan 20, 2019', 'Apr 08, 2019', 'Dec 27, 2017', 'Mar 26, 2019', 'Nov 18, 2018', 'Nov 18, 2018', 'Dec 04, 2018', 'Dec 05, 2018', 'Dec 18, 2018', 'Dec 19, 2018', 'Dec 19, 2018', 'Dec 06, 2018', 'Dec 05, 2018', 'Dec 06, 2018', 'Dec 06, 2018', 'Dec 22, 2018', 'Dec 23, 2018', 'Dec 08, 2018', 'Dec 10, 2018', 'Dec 24, 2018', 'Dec 25, 2018', 'Dec 23, 2018', 'Dec 24, 2018']</review_date></doc>

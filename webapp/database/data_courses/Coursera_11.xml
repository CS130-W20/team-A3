Peng, PhD</course_instructor><course_introduction>In this course you will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. You will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Data Analysis//Debugging//R Programming//Rstudio</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1: Background, Getting Started, and Nuts &amp; Bolts//Week 2: Programming with R//Week 3: Loop Functions and Debugging//Week 4: Simulation &amp; Profiling</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Installing R on a Mac', 'Installing R on Windows', 'Installing R Studio (Mac)', 'Writing Code / Setting Your Working Directory (Windows)', 'Writing Code / Setting Your Working Directory (Mac)', 'Introduction', 'Overview and History of R', 'Getting Help', 'R Console Input and Evaluation', 'Data Types - R Objects and Attributes', 'Data Types - Vectors and Lists', 'Data Types - Matrices', 'Data Types - Factors', 'Data Types - Missing Values', 'Data Types - Data Frames', 'Data Types - Names Attribute', 'Data Types - Summary', 'Reading Tabular Data', 'Reading Large Tables', 'Textual Data Formats', 'Connections: Interfaces to the Outside World', 'Subsetting - Basics', 'Subsetting - Lists', 'Subsetting - Matrices', 'Subsetting - Partial Matching', 'Subsetting - Removing Missing Values', 'Vectorized Operations', 'Introduction to swirl'], ['Control Structures - Introduction', 'Control Structures - If-else', 'Control Structures - For loops', 'Control Structures - While loops', 'Control Structures - Repeat, Next, Break', 'Your First R Function', 'Functions (part 1)', 'Functions (part 2)', 'Scoping Rules - Symbol Binding', 'Scoping Rules - R Scoping Rules', 'Scoping Rules - Optimization Example (OPTIONAL)', 'Coding Standards', 'Dates and Times'], ['Loop Functions - lapply', 'Loop Functions - apply', 'Loop Functions - mapply', 'Loop Functions - tapply', 'Loop Functions - split', 'Debugging Tools - Diagnosing the Problem', 'Debugging Tools - Basic Tools', 'Debugging Tools - Using the Tools'], ['The str Function', 'Simulation - Generating Random Numbers', 'Simulation - Simulating a Linear Model', 'Simulation - Random Sampling', 'R Profiler (part 1)', 'R Profiler (part 2)']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 20 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Course content was good, but assignments were too hard and not well linked to the rest of the content. I spent hours online trying to work out the assessments which then leads to the question of why the course ', 'The gap between assignments and course content/exercise is too big. Assignments are very difficult to complete without programming knowledge. ', 'I have a rudimentary background in R programming and a lot of experience with computers.  I really doubt that someone with no programming experience would be able to complete this course.  In many instances, the tools and functions needed to compete programming assignments were not taught.  In addition, functions that are taught in the class are not used at all in the homework.  The final assignment was unncessarily complicated and time consuming.  I would not recommend this class to someone who is new to programming.', 'The assignments are too hard. Wish there were more similar example walk-throughs provided. ', "I learned a lot of the R basics, but I was completely lost for the week 2 + 4 'write a function' assignments - they strike at a level too high for a complete beginner for me (and that's after religiously taking notes and completing all swirl exercises.)", 'I have programmed in SAS before (15 years ago), so I thought that experience would be sufficient for me to take this class.  I have to say it is not.  This class is definitely not for beginners - you must have programming experience, R experience and/or both.  The programming exercises do not follow the lectures and it does not build upon concepts.  You will be required to seek help elsewhere (i.e., Stack Overflow) and answers to your questions will take days, if not longer.  So, the fact that the classes are organized by week means that you will not conclude in the time you believe you will.  I feel that this class is more self-taught than anything else.  I have decided to quit this class as it has become extremely frustrating.', 'I learned a lot, but 1 star because most of the HMW are extremely hard compared to the lessons,  and has nothing to do with the lesson, they need more smaller and easier HMWs . The class need to be structured better. ', 'This course lacked organizational structure. The lessons were not in a logical progression and the material jumped around a lot. Furthermore, once a topic was introduced in a video lesson, the practice did not correspond to the lesson just learned. This made it hard to reinforce what was just learned. ', 'Very steep learning curve, especially in the beginning. the professor does not have a very engaging way of presenting his material. Also unfortunately he always requires to first think theoretical and then apply some of the learned content this for yourself. However teaching works the other way around:', 'I would be cautious to recommend this course to a complete beginner. I had been using R for about 6 months before starting this course and found the content challenging. For instance, topics like lexical scoping covered in this course are usually tackled in a more Advanced R course. For a complete beginner into R, I would recommend a book like "R in Action" by Robert Kabacoff or the course on Udemy by Jose Portilla.', 'It was always too hard to understand this course because of gaps between theory and practice. It will be much easier if you have a lot of exercises step by step mooving us to the final assignment. Like swirl but more sequential. ', 'Great course, however I think it is particularly hard for those who never had programmed in R before. Moreover I think the Programming Assignments were quite hard regarding the topics being discussed during the weeks.', 'This seemed unnecessarily difficult because I feel there was a huge gap between learning the concepts and the homework. I understand the "developing the hacker mentality" is needed but some things should not take so long.  Maybe I\'m just an idiot, but learning curve is huge. My recommendation is to be patient and google is your friend,. ', 'First off, I would like to thank you Dr. Peng for making this course. I am really happy to be one of his students and got the chance to learn so much about R programming. However, I am giving this course a 3 out 5 after completing it. The reason is that the assignments and final is extremely difficult and they do not connect so much to lecture videos. This course is 100 percent rewarding if someone can put all of their time and energy into it. But the difficulty is that if you are a starting out your programming journey, then this course can be "VERY DIFFICULT." The workload must be taken serious at all time!! ', 'The material poorly prepares you for the assignment and expects a deep commitment to a single part just to solve it. I was unable to find help in the forums or online despite doing well on the quizzes and other work. Terrible course.', 'The course can be little more better for folks who are non programmers to begin with. This is an advanced course for a beginner/non programmer, hence would recommend to have a beginner course for non programmers/ R and then this course should be offered.', 'Questions asked in the assignments were on a much higher level than what was taught in the lectures. I get it that I should do my homework and refer other sources, but that defeats the purpose of watching the videos on Coursera itself.', 'A little more explanation on how to program using R constructs would certainly help. The course suddenly throws us deep into the ocean with hardly any experience in swimming.', 'The problems are too large in comparison for what is taught. ', 'I tried to take this course 3 or 4 times and each time it turned me off of R.  The course assignments do not  match the course content and you are expected to really learn on your own by googling and what not. I finally was able to finish the course but it was hard to do it with out googling and finding other peoples answers posted on GitHub or other locations, because I did not want to cheat I did not use these other people answers although maybe that is the Hacker Mentality the professor was talking about. The professor would do well to watch this https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/opening-keynote-day2 and maybe read more about how people learn programming. ', 'Videos are difficult to follow along due to speaker.', '\n\nA very, very excellent course, really be very satisfied with what I learned during these four weeks.\n\nOnly one thing, in my opinion, I felt that the "Programming Assignment" are a little bit bigger than what is explained in the videos (and that\'s really good), but some exercises that are requested in these "Programming Assignments" could still be be added to the list of \'things to learn\', for us not to get so lost to these same.  ', 'Excelente opportunity to learn a lot. The course is very well prepared introduce you to R programing. Dont feel bad if you dont get it at te first moment. It will be a process of leaning worth trying', '"R Programming" forces you to dive in deep.', "Excellent course!  I already knew a lot about R - but this class helped me solidify what I already knew, taught me lots of new tricks, and now I have a certificate that says I know `something' about R!"]</reviews><reviewers>['By Jamie R', 'By YIQUN H', 'By James C', 'By Wei H', 'By Francesca d l F', 'By Philip H', 'By tony k', 'By Andrea', 'By Stefan H', 'By Laknath', 'By Пичугин Е Р', 'By Marta R', 'By Mohammad A A', 'By John N', 'By Tessa H', 'By Sangeeta R', 'By Satyaveer P', 'By Faylene T G', 'By Ian H', 'By kate K', 'By John K', 'By JOSÉ M O ', 'By Guilherme O B', 'By Walter H', 'By Eric J']</reviewers><review_date>['May 15, 2019', 'Apr 14, 2019', 'Jan 07, 2018', 'Apr 20, 2019', 'Apr 22, 2019', 'May 14, 2019', 'Mar 10, 2019', 'Mar 10, 2019', 'Mar 27, 2019', 'Apr 17, 2019', 'Feb 26, 2019', 'May 19, 2019', 'Nov 08, 2018', 'Apr 01, 2019', 'Feb 26, 2019', 'Apr 15, 2019', 'Feb 20, 2019', 'Feb 17, 2019', 'Mar 06, 2019', 'Feb 15, 2019', 'Oct 08, 2017', 'Jan 06, 2019', 'Feb 03, 2016', 'Feb 03, 2016', 'Jul 12, 2016']</review_date></doc>

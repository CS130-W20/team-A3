Attention is drawn to specific opportunities afforded by this new field in accelerating materials development and deployment efforts. A particular emphasis is placed on materials exhibiting hierarchical internal structures spanning multiple length/structure scales and the impediments involved in establishing invertible process-structure-property (PSP) linkages for these materials. More specifically, it is argued that modern data sciences (including advanced statistics, dimensionality reduction, and formulation of metamodels) and innovative cyberinfrastructure tools (including integration platforms, databases, and customized tools for enhancement of collaborations among cross-disciplinary team members) are likely to play a critical and pivotal role in addressing the above challenges.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Physical Science and Engineering.Chemistry</course_category><course_tag>Informatics//Materials//Statistics//Data Science</course_tag><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>Georgia Institute of Technology</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Welcome//Accelerating Materials Development and Deployment //Materials Knowledge and Materials Data Science //Materials Knowledge Improvement Cycles//Case Study in Homogenization: Plastic Properties of Two-Phase Composites//Materials Innovation Cyberinfrastructure and Integrated Workflows</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Syllabus', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Suggested Reading', 'Target Audience and Recommended Background', 'Get More from Georgia Tech', 'Consent Form'], ['Why Accelerate Material Discovery and Development?', 'Historical Materials Development Cycles', 'How do we accelerate materials development and deployment', 'Emergence of multi-stakeholder initiatives', 'The Materials Innovation Ecosystem', 'Part 1:Multiscale Modeling and Multilevel Design of Materials', 'Part 2: Multiscale Modeling and Multilevel design of Materials', 'Decision-Making in Material Design', 'Multilevel Systems-Based Materials Design'], ['Material Property, Material Structure, and Manufacturing Processes', 'Process-Structure-Property (PSP) Linkages', 'Role of Structures in PSP Linkages', 'Data Science Terminology', 'Main Components of Data Science', 'What is Big Data?'], ['Digital Representation of Material Structure', 'Spatial Correlations: n-Point Statistics', 'Computation and Visualization of 2-Point Spatial Correlations', 'Principal Component Analyses (PCA) for low dimensional representations', 'Principal Component Analyses (PCA) for low dimensional representation of material structure', 'Homogenization: Passing Information to Higher Length Scales'], ['Structure-Property Linkages using a Data Science Approach-Part 1', 'Structure-Property Linkages using a Data Science Approach-Part 2'], ['Materials Innovation Ecosystem', 'Materials Innovation Cyberinfrastucture', 'e-Collaboration Platforms/Environments', 'Materials Cyber-Infrastructure', 'Introduction to PyMKS Materials Knowledge Systems in Python', 'Materials Data Science with PyMKS']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 10 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Too much introduction, not much actual useful stuff. Too much mathematically without well illustrated examples.', 'Great introduction of the why and how of materials informatics!', 'This is a great\nstarter course for materials informatics. It covers a good amount of\ntopics and uses a nice case study to reinforce digital representation\nof data, spatial correlations, principal component analysis, and\nregression. I really liked the examples of pyMKS. My only suggestions\nis it would have been nice to have more hands-ons use of pyMKS and\nsci-kit learn. This could have been accomplished through a course\nproject or homeworks.', "I think it's wonderful course, but I did not have enough real practical skills from it (in my opinion). Thank you very much to the instructors for this course!", 'An excellent introduction to Material informatics. I highly recommend to any beginners to get started with learning informatics regarding materials.', 'Awesome Course!', 'Very nice course', 'Machine learning part and its application to material science was interesting but informative contents like material dev eco system and whole week 1 was more informative than logical', 'Brilliant lectures on a very interesting topic!', 'Thank you for the course. It is very helpful for my deeper understanding of Materials Informatics. I hope I can get more knowledge and assistance from Professors for my research in this field in future. Thank you!', 'very beneficial ', 'Very valuable course for materials modelling enthusiast. It provides me the firm grounding and preparation for my future research work in this material modeling. This course is a fine balance of technical knowledge, its implementation and the practical approaches one needs to adopt to effectively use this knowledge of materials modeling in real world. (Anupam Purwar)', 'Excellent course if you are looking to understand how to design high performance materials leveraging current advances in data sciences. ', 'its easy to do it', 'Great  expérience !', 'Best way to learn newly developed system using material data science.', 'The course was overall good but some of the course content is outdated (installing PyMKS) please look into this matter.', 'Great, fantastic information that made me see the importance of data sciences in materials science and engineering. My only request would be to potentially spend more time fleshing out PCA and the statistical tools around it; most of it went over my head without seeing a step-by-step application of it that showed the calculations. Maybe it could be optional so that those who are already strong in PCA can skip it.', 'A great introductory course into Material Data Sciences and Informatics. Had a relatively hard time when the course turned form introduction into hardcore statistics. Moreover, it can be more helpful if there are more practical projects and tutorial on introduced tools.', "Useful introduction to vocabulary and concepts in the field, but can't help but feel the pacing and scope of the course takes an abrupt switch at times.", 'This course discussed one particular issue in materials informatics. I hoped to see several other informatics-based techniques to solve problems in materials innovation.', '照本宣科。以及习题的设置，怕不是在开玩笑？', 'Too much talk about general idea. Lack of practice to learn skills ']</reviews><reviewers>['By Yichi W', 'By Bernard W', 'By stefan b', 'By Клявинек С С', 'By Kevin Y J L', 'By K.

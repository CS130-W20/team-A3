In this course, you will understand the fundamental concepts of statistical learning and learn various methods of building predictive models. At each step in the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation and building your skills, eventually culminating in a capstone project encompassing all the concepts taught in the specialization.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of California San Diego</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1: Supervised Learning &amp; Regression//Week 2: Features //Week 3: Classification//Week 4: Gradient Descent//Final Project</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to Supervised Learning', 'Supervised Learning: Regression', 'Regression in Python', 'Time-Series Regression', 'Autoregression'], ['Features from Categorical Data', 'Features from Temporal Data', 'Feature Transformations', 'Missing Values'], ['Supervised Learning: Classification', 'Classification: Nearest Neighbors', 'Classification: Logistic Regression', 'Introduction to Support Vector Machines'], ['Classification in Python', 'Introduction to Training and Testing', 'Gradient Descent in Python', 'Gradient Descent in TensorFlow', 'Livecoding: Tensorflow'], ['Project Description', 'Where to Find Datasets']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 11 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['This course takes you from learning to do many data analytics and Machine learning tasks manually  to all the way doing it much more efficiently using the standard libraries.

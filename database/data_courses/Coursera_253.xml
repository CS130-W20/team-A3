Please note: You are requested to create a short video presentation at the end of the course. This is mandatory to pass. You don't need to share the video in public.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>IBM</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1 - Identify DataSet and UseCase//Week 2 - ETL and Feature Creation//Week 3 - Model Definition and Training//Model Evaluation, Tuning, Deployment and Documentation</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Capstone Introduction'], ['Extract Transform Load (ETL)', 'Data Cleansing', 'Feature Engineering'], ['Model Definition', 'Model Training'], ['Model Evaluation', 'Model Deployment', 'Data Product (optional)', 'Create ADD - Architectural Decisions Document', 'Create a Video of your final presentation']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 10 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Capstone project is really rewarding and gives an opportunity to apply all the knowledge gained in this specialization. Peer review grading had some teething issues but Romeo made sure it all worked at the end! Big thanks to all instructors', 'Good ending to the data science certification but Foursquare API is really limited...', 'The capstone was a great way to put together and reinforce all the skills that we had learned.', "The project was fun and interesting to work on. I would be happy to see more peer-reviewed exercises as the requirements are rather loose and that would be helpful to learn other people's perspectives. ", 'I liked the peer-graded environment.', 'Very in-depth. I did not have a chance to take full advantage because I was hurrying to use up my IBM voucher. But I wish I had taken more time, to go more in-depth with my project.', 'I find this course enlightening, simple to follow and a bit challenging! I feel much more confident in my Advanced Data Science skills after this course.', 'Awesome course. Lot of learning', 'Wonderful experience of a real project development and presentation!', 'Like that course. It combine all you skills in a one project. It is very helpful for the understanding why and how ML can help for the business. Personal thanks for Romeo Kienzler!', 'n/a', 'Excellent specialization!', 'Great course, I really recommend it!', 'A great exercice, taking into account not producing models, but also elements on the process to drive a data science project.', 'I loved this course. It forced me to think. It forced me to revisit all of the previous courses. It forced me outside of my comfort zone, and into my true learning zone.', 'Innovative teacher and course. Learned how to make a youtube video beside the data science challenge.  On the whole specialization, very comprehensive and set me up to want to delve further next.', 'Hands-on work with a topic of choice. You have to get and prepare data for a problem, analyze the data, preprocess it and create machine learning models and deep learning models with the data, and present the results in an understandable way. You even have to make a presentational video (which was not much into my liking).']</reviews><reviewers>['By P', 'By Farzan B', 'By Wilton T', 'By Dmitry B', 'By Shakti s', 'By Jozeene', 'By Jose L R', 'By Khawar A A', 'By Alex P', 'By Vlad T', 'By Tobias H', 'By Sven', 'By Diego S S', 'By Bruno N', 'By Daniel T', 'By K.

K. Kharrazi, MD, Ph.D</course_instructor><course_introduction>Health data are notable for how many types there are, how complex they are, and how serious it is to get them straight. These data are used for treatment of the patient from whom they derive, but also for other uses. Examples of such secondary use of health data include population health (e.g., who requires more attention), research (e.g., which drug is more effective in practice), quality (e.g., is the institution meeting benchmarks), and translational research (e.g., are new technologies being applied appropriately). By the end of this course, students will recognize the different types of health and healthcare data, will articulate a coherent and complete question, will interpret queries designed for secondary use of EHR data, and will interpret the results of those queries.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Health.Health Informatics</course_category><course_tag>Data Science//Database (DBMS)//Data Analysis//Health Informatics//data querying</course_tag><course_rating>4.8</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Databases and Data Types//Data Sources and Data Challenges//Formulating Data Questions//Real World Applications of Data Science in Health Informatics</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to Databases', 'Databases in Clinical Informatics', 'Common Data Types I', 'Common Data Types II', 'Common Data Types III', 'Emerging Data Types'], ['Common Clinical Data Sources', 'Population-Level Data Sources', 'Data Challenges I', 'Data Challenges II', 'Data Challenges III'], ['Formulating a Data Query I', 'Formulating a Data Query II', 'Real World Data Questions', 'i2b2 Demo', 'HealthData.Gov Demo', 'HCUPNet Demo'], ['Introduction', 'Interview with Sam Meiselman', 'Interview with Sam Meiselman, Part II', 'Interview with Bonnie Woods', 'Interview with Brandyn Lau, Part I', 'Interview with Brandyn Lau, Part II', 'Interview with Brandyn Lau, Part III', 'Wrap Up']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 11 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['GOOD COURSE']</reviews><reviewers>['By sameera o a s']</reviewers><review_date>['Aug 09, 2019']</review_date></doc>

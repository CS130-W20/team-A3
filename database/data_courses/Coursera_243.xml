In this second course of the Biostatistics in Public Health Specialization, you'll learn to evaluate sample variability and apply statistical hypothesis testing methods. Along the way, you'll perform calculations and interpret real-world data from the published scientific literature. Topics include sample statistics, the central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and p values.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Health.Public Health</course_category><course_tag>Confidence Interval//Statistical Hypothesis Testing//p values//sampling</course_tag><course_rating>4.9</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Sampling Distributions and Standard Errors//Confidence Intervals for Single Population Parameters//Confidence Intervals for Population Comparison Measures//Two-Group Hypothesis Testing: The General Concept and Comparing Means//Hypothesis Testing (Comparing Proportions and Incidence Rates Between Two Populations) &amp; Extended Hypothesis Testing//Project</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction', 'Sampling Distribution Definition', 'Examples: Sampling Distribution for a Single Mean', 'Examples: Sampling Distribution for a Single Proportion, Incidence Rate', 'Estimating Sampling Distribution Characteristics from Single Samples of Data', 'Additional Examples', 'Examples: Sampling Distribution for a Single Proportion, Incidence Rate (coursera test)'], ['Introduction', 'Confidence Intervals for Single Population Parameters', 'Confidence Intervals for Population Proportions and Incidence Rates', 'So What Is a Confidence Interval, and How Should It Be Interpreted?', 'A Note on Confidence Intervals for Population Quantities Based on Small Samples', 'Additional Examples'], ['Introduction', 'Confidence Intervals for Population Comparison Measures', 'Confidence Intervals for Comparing Means of Continuous Outcomes Between Two Populations', 'Confidence Intervals for Binary Comparisons: Part 1, Difference in Proportions', 'Confidence Intervals for Binary Comparisons: Part 2, Ratio of Proportions and Odds Ratios', 'Confidence Intervals for Incidence Rate Ratios', 'A Brief Note About Ratios (Again)', 'Additional Examples'], ['Introduction', 'Hypothesis Testing: The General Concept, and for Comparing Means Between Two Populations', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Means Between Two Populations: The Paired Approach', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Means Between Two Populations: The Unpaired Approach', 'Debriefing on the p-Value, Part 1', 'Additional Examples'], ['Introduction', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Proportions Between Two Populations: The “z-Test” Approach', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Proportions Between Two Populations: Chi-Square and Fisher’s Exact Test Approaches', 'Hypothesis Tests for Comparing Incidence Rates Between Two Populations', 'Debriefing on the p-Value and Hypothesis Testing, Part 2', 'Additional Examples', 'Introduction', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Means Between More Than Two Populations: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)', '(Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Proportions Between More Than Two Populations: Chi-Square Tests', 'Hypothesis Testing) Comparing Survival Curves Between More Than Two Populations: Log-Rank Tests', 'Several Issues to Consider'], ['Biostatistical Consulting Project']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 16 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['I do recommend this course. Our Dear Professor John McGready has a clear, very objective and highly pedagogic approach to a subject of great relevance for scientific training. Congratulations teacher and thank you - very very very - much for offering us this great opportunity for professional growth!', 'Excellent course. I have a much better grasp of p-values, t-tests, z-tests, chi-square, log rank tests. Having to read medical literature as part of my job, this course has helped immensely in understanding published results. Simply fantastic use of time. ', 'It was an amazing journey for me in this course. Thank you for making this possible!', 'It was a great course i thank our guide he teaches so well. thank you so much for wonderful learning experience. ', 'I had zero understanding about Hypotheses Testing, most of the time confused about the subject till I took this course. I am happy to say I am confident in my understanding and application of it. Thank you Sir  for this course', 'Great breadth of information that is applicable to anyone who has ever needed or wanted insights from their data sets.', 'I use to hype p-value a lot but this course made me appreciate the place of p-values in a study.', 'Excellent course, very well explained and the scientific articles used were a superb way to boost my confidence that I can do this, meaning stats. Thank you!', 'Very easy to follow, at just the right level for a non-statistician who would still like to apply this in their professional / research life', 'I really enjoyed the simplicity of the presentations. I feel I still need to review the materials to ensure it sinks. All in all, This is one of the 3 online courses I have taken. ', None, 'Very useful and practic', 'One of the best course to study for the aspirants who are pursuing their career in the field of research want to understand the principle of biostatistics to apply in the research. ', 'Very well organized, thorough, and well explained.  Thank you!', 'Fantastic, intuitive and brilliantly explained', 'A very helpful course. Every concept is explained clearly ', 'Simply the best course ever illustrated so far!! Instructor Dr. John is an awesome motivator and true passionate instructor!', 'To be honest, I think some of the questions as I would find out later in this specialisation could have and should have been worded better. The grammatical or typos make it quite difficult to read the questions. Also I note with some concern that even though we are paying (yes, I agree it is a nominal sum for such a course), we are not getting the feedback and answers to our questions ALTHOUGH the course is still running and not archived. This seems to be a breach of what I signed up for. I do not expect my questions to be answered if it were a free course but I do expect some replies if we are paying for it.

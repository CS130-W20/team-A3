Developing these models and gaining insights from data do not necessarily lead to successful implementations. This depends on the ability to communicate results to those who make decisions. Presenting findings to decision makers who are not familiar with the language of analytics presents a challenge. In this course you will learn how to communicate analytics results to  stakeholders who do not understand the details of analytics but want evidence of analysis and data. You will be able to choose the right vehicles to present quantitative information, including those based on principles of data visualization. You will also learn how to develop and deliver data-analytics stories that provide context, insight, and interpretation.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Colorado Boulder</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to the Course//Best  Practices in Data Visualization//Interpreting, Telling, and Selling//Acting on Data</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['0.

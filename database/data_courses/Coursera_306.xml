The ability to summarize data, create plots and charts, and to do the tests that you commonly see in the literature is a powerful skill indeed.  Not only will it further your career, but it will put you in the position to contribute to the advancement of humanity though scientific research.

We live in a wonderful age with great tools at our disposal, ready to achieve this goal.  None are quite as easy to learn, yet as powerful to use, as the Wolfram Language.  Knowledge is literally built into the language.  With its well-structured and consistent approach to creating code, you will become an expert in no time.

This course follows the modern trend of learning statistical analysis through the use of a computer language.  It requires no prior knowledge of coding.  An exciting journey awaits.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>University of Cape Town</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1//Week 2//Week 3//Week 4</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome', 'The Klopper Research Group', 'Assumptions', 'Learning a computer language', 'Why the Wolfram language?', 'Getting Mathematica', 'The new Wolfram Cloud', 'The Wolfram Cloud', 'The Wolfram Programming Lab', 'Free-form input and Wolfram Alpha in the Cloud', 'Mathematica', 'Free-form input and Wolfram Alpha in the desktop', 'Help and documentation', 'Assignment notebooks'], ['Create Your Own Computational Essay', 'Simulated data demonstration - part 1', 'Simulated data demonstration - part 2', 'Simple arithmetic', 'Addition and subtraction', 'Multiplication and division', 'Powers', 'Arithmetical order', 'Calculating a mean', 'Working with data', 'Lists part 1', 'Lists part 2', 'Tables', 'Index', 'Datasets', 'Selecting', 'Dataset functions', 'Creating lists from datasets', 'Spreadsheets', 'Spreadsheets in the cloud'], ['Summary Statistics', 'Descriptive statistics', 'Data import for descriptive statistics', 'Creating lists for descriptive statistics', 'Point estimates', 'Measures of dispersion', 'Data Visualization', 'Data import for visualization', 'Scatter plots', 'Box plots', 'Histograms', 'Bar and pie charts', 'Distributions', 'Probability', 'PDF and CDF', 'Discrete distributions', 'Continuous distributions', 'Sampling distributions', 'Simulated data'], ['Inferential Statistics', 'Linear regression', 'Importing data', 'Descriptive statistics and visualization', 'Linear model', 'Comparing means', 'Data import', 'Comparing two means', 'Comparing more than two means', 'Comparing categorical variables', 'Contingency tables', 'Chi-squared test', 'Creating a Computational Essay', 'Data import', 'Main research question', 'Secondary research questions', 'The end']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 6 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

In this course, you will experience various data genres and management tools appropriate for each.  You will be able to describe the reasons behind the evolving plethora of new big data platforms from the perspective of big data management systems and analytical tools.  Through guided hands-on tutorials, you will become familiar with techniques using real-time and semi-structured data examples.  Systems and tools discussed include: AsterixDB, HP Vertica, Impala, Neo4j, Redis, SparkSQL. This course provides techniques to extract value from existing untapped data sources and discovering new data sources.

At the end of this course, you will be able to:
 * Recognize different data elements in your own work and in everyday life problems
 * Explain why your team needs to design a Big Data Infrastructure Plan and Information System Design
 * Identify the frequent data operations required for various types of data
 * Select a data model to suit the characteristics of your data 
 * Apply techniques to handle streaming data
 * Differentiate between a traditional Database Management System and a Big Data Management System
 * Appreciate why there are so many data management systems
 * Design a big data information system for an online game company

This course is for those new to data science.  Completion of Intro to Big Data is recommended.  No prior programming experience is needed, although the ability to install applications and utilize a virtual machine is necessary to complete the hands-on assignments.  Refer to the specialization technical requirements for complete hardware and software specifications.

Hardware Requirements: 
(A) Quad Core Processor (VT-x or AMD-V support recommended), 64-bit; (B) 8 GB RAM; (C) 20 GB disk free. How to find your hardware information: (Windows): Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties; (Mac): Open Overview by clicking on the Apple menu and clicking “About This Mac.” Most computers with 8 GB RAM purchased in the last 3 years will meet the minimum requirements.You will need a high speed internet connection because you will be downloading files up to 4 Gb in size. 

Software Requirements: 
This course relies on several open-source software tools, including Apache Hadoop. All required software can be downloaded and installed free of charge (except for data charges from your internet provider). Software requirements include: Windows 7+, Mac OS X 10.10+, Ubuntu 14.04+ or CentOS 6+ VirtualBox 5+.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Data Model//Big Data//Data Modeling//Data Management</course_tag><course_rating>4.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of California San Diego</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Big Data Modeling and Management//Big Data Modeling//Big Data Modeling (Part 2)//Working With Data Models//Big Data Management: The "M" in DBMS//Designing a Big Data Management System for an Online Game</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Big Data Modeling and Management', 'Why is this a New Course in the Big Data Specialization?', 'Summary of Introduction to Big Data (Part 1)', 'Summary of Introduction to Big Data (Part 2)', 'Summary of Introduction to Big Data (Part 3)', 'Big Data Management "Must-Ask Questions"', 'Data Ingestion', 'Data Storage', 'Data Quality', 'Data Operations', 'Data Scalability and Security', 'Energy Data Management Challenges at ConEd', 'Gaming Industry Data Management: Q&amp;A with Apmetrix CTO Mark Caldwell', 'Flight Data Management at FlightStats: A Lecture by CTO Chad Berkley'], ['Introduction to Data Models', 'Data Model Structures', 'Data Model Operations', 'Data Model Constraints', 'Introduction to CSV Data', 'What is a Relational Data Model?', 'What is a Semistructured Data Model?', 'Exploring the Relational Data Model of CSV Files', 'Exploring the Semistructured Data Model of JSON data', 'Exploring the Array Data Model of an Image', 'Exploring Sensor Data'], ['Vector Space Model', 'Graph Data Model', 'Other Data Models', "Exploring the Lucene Search Engine's Vector Data Model", 'Exploring Graph Data Models with Gephi'], ['Data Model vs. Data Format', 'What is a Data Stream?', 'Why is Streaming Data different?', 'Understanding Data Lakes', 'Exploring Streaming Sensor Data', 'Exploring Streaming Twitter Data (Optional)'], ['DBMS-based and non-DBMS-based Approaches to Big Data', 'From DBMS to BDMS', 'Redis: An Enhanced Key-Value Store', 'Aerospike: a New Generation KV Store', 'Semistructured Data – AsterixDB', 'Solr: Managing Text', 'Relational Data – Vertica'], ['A Game by Eglence Inc. : Catch The Pink Flamingo']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 16 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['informative, descriptive with hands-on experience on updated tools.', 'Just a basic overview.

This course is RESTRICTED TO LEARNERS ENROLLED IN  Strategic Business Analytics SPECIALIZATION as a preparation to the capstone project. During the first two MOOCs, we focused on specific techniques for specific applications. Instead, with this third MOOC, we provide you with different examples  to open your mind to different applications from different industries and sectors.
The objective is to give you an helicopter overview on what's happening in this field. You will see how the tools presented in the two previous courses of the Specialization are used in real life projects. 
We want to ignite your reflection process. Hence, you will best make use of the Accenture cases by watching first the MOOC and then investigate by yourself on the different concepts, industries, or challenges that are introduced during the videos.

At the end of this course learners will be able to: 
- identify the possible applications of business analytics,
- hence, reflect on the possible solutions and added-value applications that could be proposed for their capstone project.

The cases will be presented by senior practitioners from Accenture with different backgrounds in term of industry, function, and country.  Special attention will be paid to the "value case" of the issue raised to prepare you for the capstone project of the specialization.

The course is supposed to be about data and analytics, but in reality just meaningless company presentation. Some slides would be also helpful  rather than watching an employee face.', "The course is like advertisement campaign for Accenture. There isn't much real contents. ", "Be careful with this course. You have to get all questions right to pass. So, for one quizz, I spent many days doing different combinations. Is this real learning? I don't think so. I would not recommend for anyone to pay for this specialization. ", "The material doesn't have any practical value. One of the two assignments is hypothetical and vague which makes it useless.", 'I think this module does not qualify as a class, it has a lot of promotion material for Accenture, and most of the presentation are very high level and generic. this is good as a trailer for a real class.', 'Very general. I would like to see less, but more detailed examples.', "To be honesty ,I learned something new and the teachers give me some different new idea ,that's very good .", None, None, 'Business analytic explained in simple language and real case studies. Short and enjoyable videos. (recommend 1.5x~1.75x view speed)', '  Great course for becoming a data scientist  ', 'This is a good course that focuses on communicating ideas which is often a weak spot for business professionals.', None, "Honestly, after amazing first two courses in the specialization, this one is a bit of downgrade. The course is mostly stories of real business cases and the application of business analytics. I personally would prefer more R scrips and actual analysis to be done. But the whole specialization in amazing and worth it. I'm really thankful that I could learn from ESSEC and ACCENTURE. I'd give 10/5 for the specialization if I could. ", "I saw some bad reviews for this, the third part of the excellent (IMHO) Business Analytics course. I thought it was quite interesting to see and hear the Accenture leadership. I liked the cases they gave and the language  they used to describe those solutions. These learnings help me talk to my colleagues in a more 'business focussed' way.", 'Great insights from people who actually use the techniques.', 'Great and Excellent thoughts and course material.\n', 'Seems quite good and realistic but at times a little too general', '\nShould have been more hands on like the rest\n', 'An interesting brief overview of how data analytics can be applied to various business and companies. It is not very in-depth but offers some good ideals if you are particularly interested in some of the industries on how they utilize data anaytics. For me the example of Bank of Ireland and healthcare sectors are the most interesting and inspiring cases.', '\n', "Good to pick up some buzz words but overall a bit too general and vague (Nicholas Glady's part is however straight to the point and most valuable). Quizzes were sometimes obsessed with wording and less with substance. I might be too harsh but I simply don't feel I learned nearly as much as in the first two courses.", 'Instead of explaining nuggets of multiple case studies, at-least two detailed analysis of case studies would be better', 'Stories are great but nothing substantial.', 'The cases is very awesome, but for most of them the presentation, mostly the way the speakers talk in English is not sound enough.

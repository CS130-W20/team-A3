Dral</course_instructor><course_introduction>Are you ready to close the loop on your Big Data skills? Do you want to apply all your knowledge you got from the previous courses in practice? Finally, in the Capstone project, you will integrate all the knowledge acquired earlier to build a real application leveraging the power of Big Data.

You will be given a task to combine data from different sources of different types (static distributed dataset, streaming data, SQL or NoSQL storage). Combined, this data will be used to build a predictive model for a financial market (as an example). First, you design a system from scratch and share it with your peers to get valuable feedback. Second, you can make it public, so get ready to receive the feedback from your service users. Real-world experience without any 3G-glasses or mock interviews.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>Yandex</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Untitled Module</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['$null$']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 5 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

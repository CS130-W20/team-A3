Dral</course_instructor><course_introduction>There is a significant number of tasks when we need not just to process an enormous volume of data but to process it as quickly as possible. Delays in tsunami prediction can cost people’s lives. Delays in traffic jam prediction cost extra time. Advertisements based on the recent users’ activity are ten times more popular.

However, stream processing techniques alone are not enough to create a complete real-time system. For example to create a recommendation system we need to have a storage that allows to store and fetch data for a user with minimal latency. These databases should be able to store hundreds of terabytes of data, handle billions of requests per day and have a 100% uptime. NoSQL databases are commonly used to solve this challenging problem.

After you finish this course, you will master stream processing systems and NoSQL databases. You will also learn how to use such popular and powerful systems as  Kafka, Cassandra and Redis.

To get the most out of this course, you need to know Hadoop and SQL. You should also have a working knowledge of bash, Python and Spark.

And the assignments have you spend a lot of time on technical difficulties with the grader: it might work in notebooks, and then the grader keeps running it to no avail. Which makes it very hard to succeed. Week 2 is the most prominent there.', "I'm sorry but I have to say this course is very poorly executed.", 'None of the assignment worker in grader.

Thanks to deep learning, computer vision is working far better than just two years ago, and this is enabling numerous exciting applications ranging from safe autonomous driving, to accurate face recognition, to automatic reading of radiology images. 

You will:
- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
- Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
- Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

Challenging but worth it.', 'Amazing! Feels like AI is getting tamed in my hands. Course lectures , assignments are excellent. To those who are not well versed with python - numpy and tensorflow , it would be better to brush up.', 'Great course, easy to understand and very useful. The explanations are very clear, as is expected from the professor. The purpose of the course is for you to have a practical comprehension of CNNs, it will give you the necessary tools to implement you own networks, but it will not get into the specifics of each model. Nevertheless, all of the resources are referenced, which makes it very easy for you to dig deeper on any specific topic covered on the course.', "Great course for kickoff into the world of CNN's. Gives a nice overview of existing architectures and certain applications of CNN's as well as giving some solid background in how they work internally.", 'Very good however most of the effort is applied in learning and applying programming (tf, Keras) than actually thinking about the DL models and practicing different scenarios.  ', 'Wonderful course. Covers a wide array of immediately appealing subjects: from object detection to face recognition to neural style transfer, intuitively motivate relevant models like YOLO and ResNet.', 'Content is great, but videos could be trimmed to cut retakes. A big issue is that guidance for programming assignments abruptly drops off from extreme hand-holding to being thrown in the deep end.', "Great course. The only improvement I'd wish is to get a better introduction to the concepts of Tensorflow and Keras.", 'Some parts of the course seemed incomplete to me, wanted more information on why things work exactly as described. Last week assignments have a number of uncertainties/bugs.', 'When I am doing the programming assignments, I felt that some part were quite difficult since I had no background in neither Keras nor Tensorflow. It was helpful that in one of the previous courses there was a tutorial for the basics of Tensorflow. But for Keras I felt that there is a gap between what I have and what is needed for the assignment. So I would suggest a more thorough tutorial for Keras. Maybe several short tutorials talking about the implementations and ideas of Tensorflow &amp; Keras may help a lot. ', 'A short (but cogent) overview of CNNs with a ton of references to read through and much more interesting assignments (than previous courses). I really enjoyed this course, I got a ton of exposure from it.', 'This is one of the best courses for CNNs. This gives a very deep understanding of the concepts and helps to understand the brains behind the CNNs and their working in application based environments. ', 'Too much hand-holding during assignments, although still very good directions. Obviously the issue with the final programming assignment needs to be addressed. Fantastic lecture material, as always. ', 'Excellent introductory course for CNN. The basic ideas and key components are explained clearly. Coding assingments helped me understand the algorithm to every little detail. ', 'Good content, videos have the occasional editing hiccups that also affect other courses in this specialisation. Assignments could be a little bit harder but do a reasonable job at familiarising with useful deep learning frameworks.', 'Theoretical material was great as always. However, programming assignments were poorly commented in some cases which results in unnecessary confusion. ', "I think it's a good idea to remove repeated parts in the videos. Also, put all pieces toguether to give a better overview of the object detection solution", "Great lectures but the programming assignments feel as if it is testing your proficiency with tensorflow which is neither formally covered in the lecture nor the most intuitive framework to understand so you'll spend so much time digging through convoluted tensorflow documents and qna and whatnot to debug your codes that you would rather learn tensorflow formally first and then take this course and still end up finishing it faster than only going through this course only but it is only the programming assignments that basically assume that you are already familiar with the tensorflow framework so if you are only going to go over the video lectures it gives a great overview of how CNN works and many useful algorithms which can applied to a assortment of situations", 'Homeworks are too canned and do not promote deeper understanding.', 'Assignments are very bad explained', 'Dear Instructors, ', 'IoU validation problem is known but nothing as been done to resolv it', 'Great course to get insights about ConvNets and learn how they work.', '  cool  ', 'Great, interactive course. Learned a lot and there were a lot of relevant real world applications']</reviews><reviewers>['By Gyuho S', 'By Farzeen H', 'By David B C S', 'By Aleksa G', 'By fabrizio f', 'By Ed B', 'By Joshua M', 'By Markus B', 'By Sergei S', 'By Xinwei B', 'By Michael J', 'By Devjyoti M', 'By Daniel G', 'By Tian Q', 'By Cosmin D', 'By Stefan J', 'By Ralph J R F', 'By Huijun P', 'By Sriram G', 'By Alberto B', 'By divya p p', 'By Basile B', 'By Alexander T', 'By Jhon S', 'By Brandon d T']</reviewers><review_date>['Apr 25, 2019', 'Jan 12, 2019', 'Dec 17, 2018', 'Jan 13, 2019', 'Dec 17, 2018', 'Nov 03, 2017', 'Jul 31, 2019', 'Dec 05, 2018', 'Apr 29, 2019', 'Feb 13, 2019', 'Jan 02, 2019', 'Apr 22, 2019', 'Feb 14, 2018', 'Jan 01, 2019', 'Jan 04, 2019', 'Dec 30, 2018', 'Apr 27, 2019', 'Apr 18, 2019', 'Feb 10, 2019', 'Feb 08, 2019', 'Feb 18, 2019', 'Apr 30, 2018', 'Dec 12, 2018', 'Nov 26, 2018', 'Nov 26, 2018']</review_date></doc>

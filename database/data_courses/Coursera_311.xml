We focus on publicly-available structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We discuss concepts such as inhomogeneity correction, image registration, and image visualization.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Read/write images of the brain in the NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative) format
Visualize and explore these images
Perform inhomogeneity correction, brain extraction, and image registration (within a subject and to a template).</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Image Processing//Brain//R Programming//Neurology</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction//Neuroimaging: Formats and Visualization//Image Processing//Extended Image Processing</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Meet the Team', 'Introduction', 'Structural MRI and R'], ['Data Structures and Operations', 'The NIfTI Format', 'Basic Visualization 1', 'Basic Visualization 2', 'Basic Data Manipulation', 'Transformations and Smoothing', 'Basic MRI Contrasts'], ['Preprocessing: An Overview', 'Registration', 'fslr: System Requirements', 'Bias Field Correction Using fslr', 'Brain Extraction using fslr', 'Image Registration Using fslr', 'Installing ANTsR', 'Basic Data Manipulation with ANTsR', 'Pre-Processing with ANTSR'], ['Advanced Brain Image Processing', 'Co-Registration using fslr', 'Co-Registration using ANTsR', 'Wrapper Functions for Processing Pipelines', 'Across-Visit Co-Registration of T1 Images', 'Rigid Registration to a Template', 'Affine Registration of T1 to Template', 'Nonlinear Registration of T1 to Template', 'Getting ROI Anatomic Information from Non-Linear Registration', 'Tissue-Level Segmentation', 'Papayar: Interactively Viewing Images in R']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 12 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Great intro class. Recommended. ', None, 'I am really appreciate this course. Its good to have a structured course on these complex topics.', "Perfect! Precise to the subject and provides a lot of hands-on details, which is, unfortunately, something that most other similar courses don't do. Absolutely loved it! ", 'Very comprehensive step-by-step introduction to imaging analyses using R. Also includes helpful information on the nature of files and processes. I am not sure that I will do my imaging analyses using R but still found this to be a very useful introduction to the topic. ', 'I like that this course goes through most necessary steps, my only suggest would be to have one additional week where you go through everything all together, and then do some simple group analysis. ', None, None, 'Good course for the basics of neurohacking.', 'Really nice!', None, 'Great course. Learned quite a lot from the course. Only problem was the difficulty at first with the software and libraries stubbornly refusing to get setup. But, after realizing there was a VM provided with all intended software installed, everything was smooth sailing from there. ', 'It would have been better if there were practical exercises, nevertheless it was very comprehensive for basic procedures of fMRI analysis.', 'An excellent introduction to neuroimaging analysis! Tank you.', "This course offers a comprehensive description of all the steps required for the analysis of brain images. The notes are clear, concise, and contain a lot of helpful information about reading medical images, pre-processing them, and visualizing them. I'm a statistics researcher, and had very limited prior experience on this topic; but feel that this course has helped me tremendously to acquire the knowledge necessary to dive into research in this area, in a very short time. However, the benefits of taking this class go beyond this. Specifically, I was thrilled to be able to apply the techniques described here to read and visualize in R, medical images (MRI) concerning a patient-friend diagnosed with brain tumor, obtained directly from the doctor's office !!! And this, I thought, was amazing!", 'Thank you for the wonderful course. Especially useful when the team explains every new line of code. As a current undergraduate and aspiring neuroscience researcher, this is tremendously helpful. ', 'it would be great if can create a specialization for this course going in more depth like making your own dti films etc.', 'Perhaps links to some materials regarding explanation of the data could be provided.', 'Great concise walk-through of neuro-imaging techniques. Low quality audio and a lot of background noise though.', 'It was a really good course, thank you!', 'Should have more practical work', 'All the lecture were thorough and good.', 'Student presenters are not as good as professors. ', 'fxhfg', 'It was a great experience going through the processes of ways of viewing, manipulating and extracting data from brain scan images.  With few bumps on the way I keep focusing on the knowledge that I gain which I may apply into a future project of machine learn.

You will see that estimating value functions can be cast as a supervised learning problem---function approximation---allowing you to build agents that carefully balance generalization and discrimination in order to maximize reward. We will begin this journey by investigating how our policy evaluation or prediction methods like Monte Carlo and TD can be extended to the function approximation setting. You will learn about feature construction techniques for RL, and representation learning via neural networks and backprop. We conclude this course with a deep-dive into policy gradient methods; a way to learn policies directly without learning a value function. In this course you will solve two continuous-state control tasks and investigate the benefits of policy gradient methods in a continuous-action environment. This course strongly builds on the fundamentals of Courses 1 and 2.

By the end of this course, you will be able to: 

Understand how to use supervised learning approaches to approximate value functions
Understand objectives for prediction (value estimation) under function approximation
Implement TD with function approximation (state aggregation), on an environment with an infinite state space (continuous state space)

Understand new difficulties in exploration when moving to function approximation
Contrast discounted problem formulations for control versus an average reward problem formulation
Implement expected Sarsa and Q-learning with function approximation on a continuous state control task
Understand objectives for directly estimating policies (policy gradient objectives)
Implement a policy gradient method (called Actor-Critic) on a discrete state environment</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag>Artificial Intelligence (AI)//Machine Learning//Reinforcement Learning//Function Approximation//Intelligent Systems</course_tag><course_rating /><course_orgnization>University of Alberta</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Welcome to the Course!//On-policy Prediction with Approximation//Constructing Features for Prediction//Control with Approximation //Policy Gradient</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course 3 Introduction'], ['Moving to Parameterized Functions', 'Generalization and Discrimination', 'Framing Value Estimation as Supervised Learning', 'The Value Error Objective', 'Introducing Gradient Descent', 'Gradient Monte for Policy Evaluation', 'State Aggregation with Monte Carlo', 'Semi-Gradient TD for Policy Evaluation', 'Comparing TD and Monte Carlo with State Aggregation', 'The Linear TD Update', 'The True Objective for TD', 'Week 1 Summary'], ['Coarse Coding', 'Generalization Properties of Coarse Coding', 'Tile Coding', 'Using Tile Coding in TD', 'What is a Neural Network?', 'Non-linear Approximation with Neural Networks', 'Deep Neural Networks', 'Gradient Descent for Training Neural Networks', 'Optimization Strategies for NNs', 'Week 2 Review'], ['Episodic Sarsa with Function Approximation', 'Episodic Sarsa in Mountain Car', 'Expected Sarsa with Function Approximation', 'Exploration under Function Approximation', 'Average Reward: A New Way of Formulating Control Problems', 'Week 3 Review'], ['Learning Policies Directly', 'Advantages of Policy Parameterization', 'The Objective for Learning Policies', 'The Policy Gradient Theorem', 'Estimating the Policy Gradient', 'Actor-Critic Algorithm', 'Actor-Critic with Softmax Policies', 'Demonstration with Actor-Critic', 'Gaussian Policies for Continuous Actions', 'Week 4 Summary']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 17 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

I would say SAS programming specialization (and its courses) is the best one I've ever had on Coursera. It starts from simple concepts to complex tasks and projects. The best thing is the learner could get the hands dirty very quickly; usually a demo is followed with a practice task. Notice that the courses offered here are the same as those provided on SAS website (SAS itself has e-learning courses), but here you have more problems (and two projects in course 3) to practise. Highly recommend.", "This course was disappointing overall.  There is nothing you will learn, which wasn't covered in the previous two course.  Far worse, the review is done in the same sequence as the other two courses, so there really is never a chance to combine what was learned.  The challenges will be in the same order as the previous challenges, so don't expect any synthesis of skills you have developed.  There are two bigger problems, but it feels as if this course should have been a series of these.  If you are about to be billed again, there is no real reason to complete this third course.", 'This is an excellent course. I can highly recommend it. It does not only review the previous two courses but let\'s one use the acquired skills in two "real-world" assignments.', 'Excellent SAS overview, shows the strategies for data manipulation and then guides one through how to implement them.', 'Getting Harder but the Case Study are extremely helpful, thanks for all the materials.', 'Very interesting course. Learned a lot about SAS.', 'This is by far the best course I have come across in coursera. The structure of the program is excellent. The exercises are very good', 'hard but practically usefull', 'This is a wonderful course for beginners.', 'The wrap up and the exercises are very useful. I am still recommending to those who would like to take the SAS base examination.', 'Very good course. Taught how to apply concepts to real world problems. Excellent for certificate exam preparation.', 'Perfect course which gives opportunity to check knowledge and  apply it on real examples!', 'Good summary but there could be more exercises.', 'Amazing reviews for the SAS analytic tool kit. Well designed courses with segmented and modulated videos and hands-on practice. Completing all the practice exercise will give you the edge to fully familiarize with the materials covered! Aced the exam within 2 weeks of preparation.

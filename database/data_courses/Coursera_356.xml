It also introduces core concepts such as dataset elements, data warehouses and exploratory querying, and combinations of visual variables for graphic usefulness, as well as the types of statistical graphs, Â—tools that are essential to exploratory data analysis.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>3.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>Arizona State University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Getting Started//Introduction to Data Exploration Components//Exploratory Querying and Visual Variables Used in Data Exploration and Visualization//Statistical Graphics: Design Principles for the Most Widely Used Data Visualization Charts// STATISTICAL GRAPHICS: DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR Box Charts and QQ Plots</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['What is Visualization?', 'Introduction to Data Exploration', 'Data Challenges'], ['Data Models and Data Organization', 'Vector Data', 'Basis of a Vector Space', 'Vector Features', 'Vector Distance Measures', 'Vector Norms', 'Strings and Sequences'], ['Exploratory Querying', 'Visual Variables', 'Color Schemes and Design', 'Jupyter Notebooks Demonstration: Cereal Data'], ['What is Exploratory Data Analysis?', 'Introduction to Pie Charts', 'Bar and Line Charts', 'Design Considerations for Non-Data Components of Graphs', 'Creating Histograms'], ['Understanding Quartiles', 'Box and Whisker Plots', 'Q-Q Plots', 'Jupyter Notebook Demonstration: Introduction to Statistical Graphics']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 21 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>["I would have liked to complete this course; however, I kept getting malformed error messages when I tried to submit the programming assignments.  Apparently, other students have had similar issues based upon comments in the discussion forums.  I have tried to get help with the errors through the Discussion Forum and the Coursera Help Center, but so far I haven't been able to get them resolved.  It's been two weeks since I reported the issue to Coursera.", 'First, the course has no coherence. Second, it has almost no practical utility. It goes extremely deep into theory, looking like it was designed to fill as much time as possible. For example, why so much time was spent on vector spaces and rigorous mathematical definitions of distance - is bewildering... ', 'The lectures are excellent and the quizzes fairly assess the content presented.  However, as discussed bu numerous people in the use Forum, a malfunction is present that prevents submission of programming assignments.  Also, the assignments assume familiarity with Python or SQl that extends beyond the video instructions.  Like other participants have document, I too have escalated to Coursera without any resolution.', 'Good Course', 'The concepts were clearly explained in a practical manner. I am already able to upon it.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Jason C', 'By AK', 'By Carl W', 'By Sameera  K', 'By Adesola F']</reviewers><review_date>['Aug 07, 2018', 'Nov 26, 2018', 'Oct 10, 2018', 'Oct 15, 2018', 'Aug 15, 2018']</review_date></doc>

We'll introduce the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and cover how next-generation sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. You'll also get an introduction to the key concepts in computing and data science that you'll need to understand how data from next-generation sequencing experiments are generated and analyzed.

But if you think you have got the basics down, that means this course will be too easy for you.", 'A good basic introduction. Might have been nice to have had recommendations for further reading for those who were interested.', 'Fantastic course from two true authorities in the field.  Great examples, and I was surprisingly enthralled by the statistical section; turns out I just never had the right teacher!', 'Have tried a few other courses around introduction to genomic technologies but this is the best structured course I have taken. Loved the course project as it gives a good insight on how to read scientific papers and what is expected from a genomic scientist. The only point would be to improve the statistics content(week 4) and make it more beginner friendly especially when it comes to p-values.', 'good ', 'Very good introduction. ', 'I found the course to be very clear and informative. I believe the molecular biology aspect was easy enough for someone without a background in biology or biochemistry to understand. Also, the computer science and statistical aspects were also explained in a clear way.', 'Quite good explanation of molecular biology and statistics. Hope the narrator can lower down the speed, since it is a little tough for a non-native English speaker to catch-up with it (Though the pronunciation is very clear)', 'Gained good knowledge', "Very good introductory course. It's a lot of material to cover for a newbie, but if you have some background, you will find you progress pretty quickly. Enjoyable, engaging, fun and useful.", 'Good beginner course to introduce genomics', 'Good course in introducing main concepts of specialization.', 'It seemed a little too easy, especially for the timeline given. Seemed like there should have been more information, or have gone more in-depth', 'Moves too fast, but excellent content and information. Very engaging! ', "This is my first course in Genomic Technologies (and one I completed overall). I was taking this course bit lightly for being the introductory/basic course but I have learnt a number of new things: Introduction to some stats terms I overlooked/haven't learnt before like p-test and confounders, the incredible example of data-counterfeiting in the academia and how PCR and next-gen sequencing technologies work. Although I couldn't learn in depth, which is obvious since its first of the 8 course specialization, so I am anxious to take the next course - this specialization is looking very exciting.", 'great ', "Good intro for people who don't have any background, a little too simple for people who already work in this criteria or have knowledge about", None, 'Good class but incredibly basic.  Needs to go a bit more in depth.  Feels rushed.', 'Pretty basic introduction. Not bad, not outstanding, just average: 3 stars.', 'Basic course', 'It was difficult, especially towards the end. But I dig it! And will keep pushing forward! Thanks!', 'good class, learn a lot!', 'Classes were perfect!

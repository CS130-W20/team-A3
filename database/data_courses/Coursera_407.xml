In response to business requirements presented in a case study, you’ll design and build a small data warehouse, create data integration workflows to refresh the warehouse, write SQL statements to support analytical and summary query requirements, and use the MicroStrategy business intelligence platform to create dashboards and visualizations.

In the first part of the capstone course, you’ll be introduced to a medium-sized firm, learning about their data warehouse and business intelligence requirements and existing data sources. You’ll first architect a warehouse schema and dimensional model for a small data warehouse. You’ll then create data integration workflows using Pentaho Data Integration to refresh your data warehouse. Next, you’ll write SQL statements for analytical query requirements and create materialized views to support summary data management. Finally, you will use MicroStrategy OLAP capabilities to gain insights into your data warehouse. In the completed project, you’ll have built a small data warehouse containing a schema design, data integration workflows, analytical queries, materialized views, dashboards and visualizations that you’ll be proud to show to your current and prospective employers.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Data Warehousing//Microstrategy//Data Warehouse//SQL</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Colorado System</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Course Overview//Data Warehouse Design//Data Integration//Analytical Queries and Summary Data Management// Data Visualization and Dashboard Design Requirements  //Wrap Up and Project Submission</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course introduction', 'Course topics and assignments video lesson', 'Executive interview'], ['Executive interview'], ['Executive interview', 'Executive interview', 'Executive interview'], ['Executive Interview with Kellyn Gorman of Oracle'], ['Executive Interview with Matthew Caton of Data Source Consulting', 'Executive Interview with Tyler Wilson on BI Platform Capabilities at CPI Card Group'], ['Executive Interview with James Gualke on the State of BI Maturity and Strategy at PDC Energy', 'Course conclusion video lecture']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 8 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['I have submitted all my solution long back but the last submission which was suppose to been by mentor is pending from one and the half months.', 'The course is not very well developed like course 1, 2, 3.', 'Course is good but mentor grading needs to be a bit sorted as in they required almost 2 additional weeks to grade one assignment in total that is 1 month to grade an assignment so that needs to be taken care of', 'far too few students who rate your work - you always need to wait very long for reviews', 'Excelent course.

All of the assignments were challenging but fair.  Unfortunately, I do not feel the same way about the data visualization module.  The sample dashboards provided are not well done enough to be used in a professional setting.', 'this is an excellent and rigorous course and a valuable preparation for working with data warehouses. frustratingly, the assignments contained errors, inconsistencies, and vagaries that left me wondering if the professors did this on purpose, to simulate real world situations. anyway, the bottom line is that this course offers a great opportunity to learn and practice. they say you get out of it only what you put into it. be prepared to spend 8 to 16 hours on the assignments. but it definitely was worth it. THANK YOU, PROFESSORS!']</reviews><reviewers>['By Shrey P S', 'By Fernando', 'By Ankit M', 'By Daniel M', 'By Małgorzata J', 'By Carlos P', 'By Kasani P', 'By Roberto T I', 'By Peter S', 'By E.Naveen K', 'By Jordi P L', 'By Sachin G', 'By Ranga', 'By Obinna E', 'By DevendraMehra', 'By Prasant k n', 'By abel.saenz@gmail.com', 'By Pratik A', 'By Qiao D', 'By Rakshit G', 'By Rajat K j', 'By BENSON E A', 'By Paul G', 'By Matthew D', 'By Robert L']</reviewers><review_date>['Nov 23, 2016', 'Feb 06, 2017', 'Dec 09, 2016', 'Aug 22, 2018', 'Feb 11, 2017', 'Oct 17, 2017', 'Feb 12, 2017', 'Oct 09, 2017', 'Aug 13, 2016', 'Nov 18, 2016', 'Aug 12, 2016', 'May 15, 2016', 'May 05, 2016', 'May 25, 2016', 'Jun 28, 2016', 'Dec 09, 2016', 'Jul 17, 2017', 'Aug 26, 2016', 'Oct 20, 2017', 'Jan 09, 2017', 'Jun 04, 2016', 'Aug 18, 2019', 'Aug 13, 2018', 'Oct 03, 2017', 'May 30, 2016']</review_date></doc>

Peng, PhD</course_instructor><course_introduction>This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Knitr//Data Analysis//R Programming//Markup Language</course_tag><course_rating>4.5</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1: Concepts, Ideas, &amp; Structure//Week 2: Markdown &amp; knitr//Week 3: Reproducible Research Checklist &amp; Evidence-based Data Analysis//Week 4: Case Studies &amp; Commentaries</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction', 'What is Reproducible Research About?', 'Reproducible Research: Concepts and Ideas (part 1)', 'Reproducible Research: Concepts and Ideas (part 2) ', 'Reproducible Research: Concepts and Ideas (part 3) ', 'Scripting Your Analysis ', 'Structure of a Data Analysis (part 1)', 'Structure of a Data Analysis (part 2)', 'Organizing Your Analysis'], ['Coding Standards in R', 'Markdown', 'R Markdown', 'R Markdown Demonstration', 'knitr (part 1)', 'knitr (part 2) ', 'knitr (part 3) ', 'knitr (part 4) ', 'Introduction to Course Project 1'], ['Communicating Results', 'RPubs ', 'Reproducible Research Checklist (part 1)', 'Reproducible Research Checklist (part 2) ', 'Reproducible Research Checklist (part 3) ', 'Evidence-based Data Analysis (part 1)', 'Evidence-based Data Analysis (part 2) ', 'Evidence-based Data Analysis (part 3) ', 'Evidence-based Data Analysis (part 4) ', 'Evidence-based Data Analysis (part 5) '], ['Caching Computations', 'Case Study: Air Pollution', 'Case Study: High Throughput Biology', 'Commentaries on Data Analysis', 'Introduction to Peer Assessment 2']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 10 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['I often feel like people completely ignore the "science" aspect of data science (read any data science career question on quora for example). This course does an excellent job of introducing key aspects of the scientific method that you might not have encountered if you\'ve never done an experiment before. The final project is a lot of work (mostly data cleaning) but very fun and informative.', 'Too expensive for such a simple course', "I've already written a review but it seems to have been removed...", 'Great course very informative', 'Good course content. All things explained quite well. ', 'Excellent Course - particular useful for anyone doing research and performing any kind of analysis on the observed data. ', 'A great introduction to basics of scientific method concerning statistics and result reporting.', 'Amazing course, it introduced the concepts of reproducibility which is used to provide scientific fairness, transparency. ', 'Very good course', 'One of my favorite courses in the specialization so far. ', 'Would definitey recommend this, it covers an important aspect of research for Data Scientists.', 'Great course, good lectures. I learned a lot of usable skills.', 'Favorite course so far. Really enjoyed working on the projects. They were very helpful in helping to reinforce the material.', 'A great course that will take you ahead to be a Data Scientist', 'Knitr was a nice tool to learn. I can see it being useful.', 'Quite good course.', 'good work', 'Great course. Make you think like a scientist.', "These are important skills for a data scientist and I'm glad there is a full 4-week course dedicated to reproducible research.", '  Taught useful things!  ', 'Perfect to aid past and present curation and validation of research.  Thank you!', 'I enjoyed this one so much! Give me more...', 'The concept introduced here is very essential and basic for high quality data analysis', 'Loved it! I am not as technical as others in my class, so I struggle a bit with the programming part. However, I understand the importance of and now how to perform Reproducible Research in an industry-wide format. The examples given in the videos, especially regarding medical studies gone awry, stress the importance of attention to detail and reproducibility.', 'I was able to learn very good base to assure my work can be reproduced within my peers.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Matthew S', 'By Dzmitry S', 'By Chris M', 'By Mahmoud E', 'By Chanpreet K', 'By Anusha V', 'By Bruno R d C S', 'By Azat G', 'By Fidel S C', 'By Andrew', 'By Naren R B', 'By carlos j m', 'By Glenn W', 'By Alzum S M', 'By Carl W', 'By Aleksander Z', 'By 刘博', 'By Solomonov A', 'By Donald J', 'By Ryan C Y H', 'By Jose P', 'By Vitalii S', 'By 陈颐欢', 'By George G A', 'By Atair A C j']</reviewers><review_date>['Mar 05, 2019', 'May 10, 2016', 'Apr 09, 2016', 'Nov 27, 2018', 'Dec 30, 2018', 'Jan 03, 2019', 'Jan 22, 2019', 'Jan 24, 2019', 'Mar 20, 2019', 'Apr 07, 2019', 'Apr 08, 2019', 'Apr 12, 2019', 'Mar 04, 2019', 'Jan 08, 2019', 'Jul 10, 2018', 'Apr 25, 2017', 'Mar 03, 2017', 'Jan 19, 2017', 'Jan 22, 2018', 'Jul 02, 2017', 'Feb 12, 2018', 'Jun 27, 2017', 'Jun 11, 2018', 'Aug 20, 2017', 'Oct 07, 2017']</review_date></doc>

We'll learn about reading, storing, and processing tabular data, which are common tasks.  We will also teach you about CSV files and Python's support for reading and writing them.  CSV files are a generic, plain text file format that allows you to exchange tabular data between different programs. These concepts and skills will help you to further extend your Python programming knowledge and allow you to process more complex data.

By the end of the course, you will be comfortable working with tabular data in Python. This will extend your Python programming expertise, enabling you to write a wider range of scripts using Python.

This course uses Python 3.  While most Python programs continue to use Python 2, Python 3 is the future of the Python programming language. This course uses basic desktop Python development environments, allowing you to run Python programs directly on your computer.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Computer Science.Software Development</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>Rice University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Dictionaries//Tabular Data and Nested Data Structures//Tabular Data and CSV Files//Organizing Data</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome!', 'Class Structure', 'Python Dictionaries', 'Defining a Dictionary', 'Dictionary Lookup and Update', 'Checking Keys', 'Handling Dictionary Errors'], ['Iteration over Dictionaries', 'Tabular Data as a Nested List', 'Tabular Data as a Nested Dictionary', 'Displaying Dictionaries'], ['Tables and CSV Files', 'Parsing CSV Files', "Python's CSV Module", 'CSV DictReader', 'CSV Reader Options', 'Experimenting with CSV Methods - Part 1', 'Experimenting with CSV Methods - Part 2', 'Project Video for Part 1'], ['Sorting', 'Lambda', 'Advanced Sorting', 'Refactoring Your Code - Part 1', 'Refactoring Your Code - Part 2', 'Project Video for Part 2']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 12 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Excellent and challenging, especially the final project', "Overly simplistic lessons and quizzes followed by brutal projects that require you to teach yourself techniques not covered in the lessons.  Now I don't feel like I've learned anything because I've just had to trial-error my way through half the code.  What worked, what didn't work?  I can't remember...", 'I just dislike coding', 'Cool Thanks))', 'I really liked the course, thank you so much!', 'Very good course, instructor presented it well.', 'Course was excellent . Loved learning it', 'Excellent course! Great material, challenging exercises.', 'Awesome course. Challenging final project.', 'Important concepts covered - including dictionaries and data structures. Useful in developing a basic foundation and understanding of Python.', 'Thanks for materials and course!!!', '{for me : very helpful!}', 'The Mentor is very helpful', 'Really good lecturing and real stuff learned! ', 'Really good stuff.', 'The reading and writing file csv file part is difficult, especially reading data into dictionary part.', 'The material is taught in a straightforward and easily accessible manner which can lull you into thinking that this is easy, but it is not.  The final assignment and optional programming exercise in the last week will really force you to dig deep to put it all together.  Everything you need is right there in the lecture notes you just have to be willing to listen.  Great course.', 'Very good online course! ', 'This was more challenging then previous two', "It's fantastic learning opportunity, well taught, covered almost everything.Baseball project is cherry on the cake.", 'Really made me to work hard.', 'Excellent...', 'De mucha utilidad, permite ver la gran variedad de funciones que dispone Python. ', 'This is an excellent program.  I have written most complicated and exciting Python programs, I have ever thought that I could write!', "Definitely more challenging than the previous, but if you want to be serious about scripting in Python, very few other courses will get you there than this one. A little too focused on reading csv files than I wanted, but even then, I was provided with enough challenges working with dictionaries, lists, all the while learning new Python skills (lambda functions, list comprehensions, etc.) that I can't really give it anything below 5 stars."]</reviews><reviewers>['By Sergio G S', 'By Bradley S', 'By Edwin R', 'By Farhodjon A', 'By Nicholas S', 'By 林晉宇', 'By vivek', 'By Rodrigo B M', 'By Sebastian R S', 'By Joanne H P C ', 'By Abdurahmonov A', 'By liping', 'By Shan G', 'By Jingxiong L', 'By Gabriel F', 'By Biao Y', 'By Fil G', 'By Robert L', 'By Arvydas K', 'By Dheeraj R', 'By Felix O', 'By Abdul W', 'By Jose D', 'By Jatinderpal P', 'By Humberto O']</reviewers><review_date>['Jul 04, 2019', 'Feb 15, 2019', 'May 22, 2018', 'Dec 15, 2018', 'Dec 21, 2018', 'Jan 10, 2019', 'Jan 15, 2019', 'Feb 18, 2019', 'Feb 19, 2019', 'Jan 30, 2019', 'Jan 08, 2019', 'Jul 12, 2018', 'Jul 14, 2018', 'Sep 13, 2018', 'Aug 26, 2018', 'Oct 06, 2018', 'Oct 26, 2018', 'Nov 09, 2018', 'Jul 18, 2018', 'Aug 04, 2018', 'Aug 23, 2018', 'Aug 23, 2018', 'Aug 06, 2018', 'Aug 24, 2018', 'Jul 04, 2018']</review_date></doc>

Incomplete information about how the work was done, where the files are, and which is the most recent version can give rise to many complications. This course  focuses on the proper documentation creation process, allowing you and your colleagues to easily reproduce the components of your workflow. Throughout this course, you'll receive helpful demonstrations of RStudio and the R Markdown language and engage in active learning opportunities to help you build a professional online portfolio.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>Emory University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Reproducible Research and Dynamic Documentation//R Markdown: Syntax, Document, and Presentation Formats//R Markdown Templates: Processing and Customizing//Leveraging Custom Templates from Leading Scientific Journals//Working in Teams and Disseminating Templates and Reports</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome and an Introduction to the Course', 'Welcome to Week 1!', 'History and Importance of Reproducibility', 'Dynamic Documentation and Literate Programming', 'Components and Examples of Reproducibility', 'R and RStudio Introduction', 'Git and Github - Part 1', 'Git and Github - Part 2', 'Git and Github - Part 3', 'Creating Your First Document', 'Wrap-Up'], ['Welcome to Week 2!', 'Introduction to R Markdown and the YAML Header', 'R Markdown Syntax', 'Figures, Tables, and Equations', 'Images, Videos, and Footnotes', 'Presentation Formats', 'Book Format', 'Wrap-Up'], ['Week 3 Introduction', 'Customizing an HTML Document', 'Customizing a WORD Document', 'Customizing Other Document Formats', 'Working with R Packages', 'Building a Document Template, Part 1', 'Building a Document Template, Part 2', 'Adding Parameters in a Document Template', 'Wrap-Up'], ['Week 4 Introduction', 'Examples and Demo of Existing Templates', 'Exploring R Packages and Their Components and Files', 'Create an R Markdown Template and Share It', 'Create an R Package with an R Markdown Template', 'Wrap-Up'], ['Week 5 Introduction', 'Organizing Components - Files, Documents, and Codes', 'Disseminate Your Files via RPubs and GitHub', 'Communicating to Your Team on How to Use Your Templates and Projects', 'More Ways to Disseminate Your Files', 'Wrap-Up']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 21 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Excellent experience!', 'Especially if you are in the first 20 hours of learning to use Git, github, R|RStudio, R Markdown, I think this course will be well-worth your time; an efficient and friendly introduction to those tools/platforms.', 'Well designed with useful practical exercises', 'Perfect amount of info for beginner and/or intermediate R user who has not taken full advantage of its capabilities (yet)']</reviews><reviewers>['By Christian K J S', 'By Todd F P', 'By Gail C', 'By VINCENT C F']</reviewers><review_date>['Mar 02, 2019', 'Mar 25, 2018', 'Jun 21, 2018', 'Feb 22, 2018']</review_date></doc>

This course helps you do just that! Machine learning is the process of developing, testing, and applying predictive algorithms to achieve this goal. Make sure to familiarize yourself with course 3 of this specialization before diving into these machine learning concepts. Building on Course 3, which introduces students to integral supervised machine learning concepts, this course will provide an overview of many additional concepts, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning, from basic classification to decision trees and clustering. By completing this course, you will learn how to apply, test, and interpret machine learning algorithms as alternative methods for addressing your research questions.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag>Data Analysis//Python Programming//Machine Learning//Exploratory Data Analysis</course_tag><course_rating>4.1</course_rating><course_orgnization>Wesleyan University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Decision Trees//Random Forests//Lasso Regression//K-Means Cluster Analysis</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['What Is Machine Learning?', 'Machine Learning and the Bias Variance Trade-Off', 'What Is a Decision Tree?', 'What is the Process of Growing a Decision Tree?', 'Building a Decision Tree with SAS', 'Strengths and Weaknesses of Decision Trees in SAS', 'Building a Decision Tree with Python'], ['What Is A Random Forest and How Is It "Grown"?', 'Building a Random Forest with SAS', 'Building a Random Forest with Python', 'Validation and Cross-Validation'], ['What is Lasso Regression?', 'Testing a Lasso Regression with SAS', 'Data Management for Lasso Regression in Python', 'Testing a Lasso Regression Model in Python', 'Lasso Regression Limitations'], ['What Is a k-Means Cluster Analysis?', 'Running a k-Means Cluster Analysis in SAS, pt. 1', 'Running a k-Means Cluster Analysis in SAS, pt. 2', 'Running a k-Means Cluster Analysis in Python, pt. 1', 'Running a k-Means Cluster Analysis in Python, pt. 2', 'k-Means Cluster Analysis Limitations']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 12 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>["The course was indeed pretty interesting, I've learned a lot of new things (and got to learn how to do a little bit of coding using Python). The only thing I would recommend is to add some more datasets, because even though it's pretty easy to find some datasets on the Internet, I think 3 out of 5 suggested datasets were extremely difficult to figure out and were much more complex than the other two.", 'Not impressed with the teaching style.', 'GREAT KNOWLEDGE', 'Excellent course', 'Great course!', 'easy to capture the concept', 'Great classes. It is the beginning to machine learning, and you can try more classes about it. You can find many job about it.', 'Option of learning both SAS and Python is great!', 'There is some problems because of changes both in SAS and Python after creating the course', '\n', 'все супер', "I enjoyed this course a lot. It's easy and I've learnt what I need to apply the machine learning techniques. Easy and simple. You don't need to be a mathematician.  ", None, "A must to do introductory course. I will never regrett taking that valuable course but I have to say that some improvements would make it much better. The theoretical background is too short and the proffesors seem to spend more time to describe simple functions like saying put there an ('underscore', 'parenthesis') than seting the reasons of doing that and what are the targets of the programmes. Any way all of these problems and maybe some more are not a reason for someone who wants to start machine learning to not participate in that course especially if he is a pythonist.", None, 'Good introduction with python example for famous algorithm such as random forest and k-mean', None, None, 'Good!', "Very good course. I recommend to anyone who's interested in data analysis and machine learning.", 'Excelente curso. Explicações didáticas com exemplos reais implementados e detalhados em python. Descrição muito boa das aplicações das técnicas apresentadas bem como de suas limitações. Parabéns para as professoras por esse excelente curso e muito obrigada por nos disponibilizar este trabalho maravilhoso no Coursera.', 'Well structured .', 'It is very interesting, helpful, useful and wonderful course. Everybody who interesting in statistic must surely learn this course.', 'Great Class!', 'A good introduction to Machine Learning. Makes me curious to know about the methods that are available outside of this course. Great material as usual.

I am looking for a new Data Scientist career ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseantonio11) ', "It's an excellent course for beginners. My suggestion is that the course should talk about the failures of AI to date. I recognize that data collection is still a big issue, and that AI will not work as robustly with limited data. That was the experience that IBM had in implementing Watson in the healthcare field. There are stumbling blocks (which people should be informed about) and challenges ahead. Thank you.", 'This course has piqued my interest, now I cannot get enough and aim to complete the entire specialization. ', 'Overall, a great overview of the general concept and field of study that is AI.  It was enough to get me excited, for sure.

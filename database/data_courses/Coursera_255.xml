From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R.
 
Weâ€™ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be  completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results.
 
In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations.
 
In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications  as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Develop an analytic mindset//Clean and Merge Data//Visualize Data//Analyze Data//Introduction to coding</course_tag><course_rating /><course_orgnization>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</course_orgnization><course_chapter>INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE//MODULE 1: INTRODUCTION TO ACCOUNTANCY ANALYTICS//MODULE 2: ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS AND AN ANALYTICS MINDSET//MODULE 3: DATA AND ITS PROPERTIES//MODULE 4: DATA VISUALIZATION 1//MODULE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION 2//MODULE 6: ANALYTIC TOOLS IN EXCEL 1//MODULE 7: ANALYTIC TOOLS IN EXCEL 2//MODULE 8: AUTOMATION IN EXCEL</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Introduction', 'About Ronald Guymon'], ['Module 1 Introduction', '1.1.1 History and Future of Accounting', '1.1.2 The Importance of Data and Analytics in Accounting', "1.1.3 Humans' Relationship with Data", "1.1.4 Accountants' Role in Shaping How Data Is Used", '1.1.5 Data Analytics Tools: Spreadsheets vs. Data Science Languages', '1.2.1 Advanced Data Analytics in Managerial Accounting Overview', '1.2.2 Advanced Data Analytics in Auditing Overview', '1.2.3 Advanced Data Analytics in Financial Accounting Overview', '1.2.4 Advanced Data Analytics in Taxes Overview', '1.2.5 Advanced Data Analytics in Systems Accounting Overview', 'Module 1 Conclusion'], ['Module 2 Introduction', '2.1.1 Making Room for Empirical Enquiry', '2.1.2 System 1 vs. System 2 Mindset', '2.2.1 Linking Core Courses to Analytical Thinking', '2.2.2 Inductive and Deductive Reasoning', '2.2.3 Advanced Analytics and the Art of Persuasion', '2.3.1 FACT Framework: Frame the Question', '2.3.2 FACT Framework: Assemble the Data', '2.3.3 FACT Framework: Calculate Results', '2.3.4 FACT Framework: Tell Others About the Results', '2.3.5 FACT Framework Review', 'Module 2 Conclusion'], ['Module 3 Introduction: What is Data?', '3.1.1 Characteristics that Make Data Useful for Decision Making', '3.2.1 Structured vs. Unstructured Data', '3.2.2 Properties of a Tidy Dataframe', '3.2.3 Data Types', '3.2.4 Data Dictionaries', '3.3.1 Wide Data vs. Long Data', '3.3.2 Merging Data', '3.3.3 Data Automation', '3.4.1 Visualization Distributions', '3.4.2 Visualizing Data Relationships', 'Module 3 Conclusion'], ['Module 4 Introduction', '4.1.1 Why Visualize Data?', '4.1.2 Visual Perception Principles', '4.1.3 Data Visualization Building Blocks', '4.2.1 Basic Chart Data', '4.2.2 Scatter Plots', '4.2.3 Bar Charts', '4.2.4 Box and Whisker Plots', '4.2.5 Line Charts', '4.2.6 Maps', '4.3.1 Financial Chart Data', '4.3.2 Waterfall Charts', '4.3.3 Candlestick Charts', '4.3.4 Treemaps and Sunburst Charts', '4.3.5 Sparklines and Facets', '4.3.6 Charts to Use Sparingly', 'Module 4 Conclusion'], ['Module 5 Introduction', '5.1.1 Getting Started with Tableau', '5.1.2 Scatter Plots in Tableau - 1', '5.1.3 Scatter Plots in Tableau - 2', '5.1.4 Bar Charts and Histograms in Tableau', '5.1.5 Box Plots and Line Charts in Tableau', '5.2.1 Adding Dimensions in Tableau', '5.2.2 Facets and Groups in Tableau', '5.3.1 Data Joins in Tableau', '5.3.2 Tableau Analytics - Forecasts', '5.3.3 Tableau Analytics - Clusters and Confidence Intervals', '5.4.1 Communicating Tableau Analyses', 'Module 5 Conclusion'], ['Module 6 Introduction', "6.1.1 Framing a Question: Larry's Commissary", '6.1.2 Assembling Data', '6.1.3 Data Analysis ToolPak and Descriptive Statistics', '6.1.4 Correlation', '6.2.1 Linear Models', '6.2.2 Simple Regression', '6.2.3 Regression Diagnostics 1: Regression Summary, ANOVA, and Coefficient Estimates', '6.3.1 Multiple Regression', '6.3.2 Regression Diagnostics 2: Predicted Values, Residuals, and Standardized Residuals', '6.3.3 Regression Diagnostics 3: Line Fit Plots, Adjusted R Square, and Heat Maps for P-Values', '6.4.1 Making a Forecast with a Linear Model', 'Module 6 Conclusion'], ['Module 7 Introduction', '7.1.1 Polynomial Regression Models', '7.1.2 Categorical Variables', '7.1.3 Multiple Indicator Variables', '7.1.4 Interaction Terms', '7.1.5 Regression Summary', '7.2.1 Optimization with Excel Solver', '7.2.2 Solver Constraints and Reports', '7.3.1 Logit Transformation', '7.3.2 Simple Logistic Regression', '7.3.3 Logistic Regression Accuracy', 'Module 7 Conclusion'], ['Module 8 Introduction', '8.1.1 Recording Macros', '8.1.2 Basics of VB Editor', '8.1.3 Basics of VBA', '8.2.1 For Loops, Variables, Index Numbers, and Last Rows', '8.2.2 Programming Hints', '8.2.3 Conditional Statements', '8.3.1 Macro for Creating Multiple Histograms', '8.3.2 Clustering Overview', '8.3.3 K-Means Clustering in Excel', '8.3.4 K-Means Clustering Macro', '8.3.5 Clustering On a Larger Scale', 'Module 8 Conclusion']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 33 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Excellent content!

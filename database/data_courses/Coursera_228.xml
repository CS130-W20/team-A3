In addition, a business case study is defined to guide participants through all steps of the analytical life cycle, from problem understanding to model deployment, through data preparation, feature selection, model training and validation, and model assessment. A series of demonstrations and exercises is used to reinforce the concepts and the analytical approach to solving business problems. 

This course uses Model Studio, the pipeline flow interface in SAS Viya that enables you to prepare, develop, compare, and deploy advanced analytics models. You learn to train supervised machine learning models to make better decisions on big data. The SAS applications used in this course make machine learning possible without programming or coding.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>SAS</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Course Overview//Getting Started with Machine Learning using SAS®  Viya®//Data Preparation and Algorithm Selection//Decision Trees and Ensembles of Trees//Neural Networks//Support Vector Machines//Model Deployment</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to the Course!'], ['Introduction', 'Machine Learning in SAS Viya', 'Analytics Life Cycle', 'Case Study: Customer Churn', 'SAS Viya Tools for SAS Visual Data Mining and Machine Learning', 'Demo: Creating a Project', 'Predictive Modeling', 'Importance of Data Preparation', 'Essential Data Tasks', 'Dividing the Data', 'Addressing Rare Events Using Event-Based Sampling', 'Demo: Modifying the Data Partition', 'Managing Missing Values', 'Demo: Building a Pipeline from a Basic Template', 'SAS Viya in the SAS Platform: Architecture'], ['Introduction to Data Preparation and Algorithm Selection', 'Exploring the Data', 'Demo: Exploring the Data', 'Replacing Incorrect Values', 'Demo: Replacing Incorrect Values Starting on the Data Tab', 'Feature Creation', 'Text Mining', 'Demo: Adding Text Mining Features', 'Using Transformations to Handle Extreme or Unusual Values', 'Demo: Transforming Inputs', 'Selecting Useful Inputs', 'Demo: Selecting Features', 'Demo: Saving a Pipeline to the Exchange', 'Essential Discovery Tasks and Selecting an Algorithm'], ['Introduction to Decision Trees and Ensembles of Trees', 'Basics of Decision Trees', 'Demo: Building a Decision Tree Model Using the Default Settings', 'Decision Trees for Categorical Targets: Classification Trees', 'Decision Trees for Interval Targets: Regression Trees', 'Improving the Decision Tree Model', 'Demo: Modifying the Structure Parameters', 'Recursive Partitioning', 'Splitting Criteria', 'Split Search', 'Demo: Modifying the Recursive Partitioning Parameters', 'Optimizing the Complexity of a Decision Tree Model', 'Pruning', 'Demo: Modifying the Pruning Parameters', 'Regularizing and Tuning the Hyperparameters of a Machine Learning Model', 'Building Ensemble Models', 'Perturb and Combine Methods', 'Bagging', 'Boosting', 'Comparison of Tree-Based Models', 'Demo: Building a Gradient Boosting Model', 'Forest Models', 'Demo: Building a Forest Model'], ['Introduction to Neural Networks', 'Beyond Traditional Regression: Neural Networks', 'Limitations of Neural Networks', 'Basics of Neural Networks', 'Estimating Weights and Making Predictions', 'Learning Process', 'Essential Discovery Tasks for Neural Networks', 'Demo: Building a Neural Network Using the Default Settings', 'Improving the Neural Network Model', 'Neural Network Architectures', 'Activation Functions', 'Shaping the Sigmoid', 'Demo: Modifying the Neural Network Architecture', 'Optimizing the Complexity of a Neural Network Model', 'Weight Decay', 'Early Stopping', 'Regularizing and Tuning the Hyperparameters of a Neural Network Model', 'Demo: Modifying the Learning and Optimization Parameters'], ['Introduction to Support Vector Machines', 'Support Vector Machines as Classifier Models', 'Mathematical Definition of a Support Vector Machine', 'Maximum-Margin Hyperplane and Support Vectors', 'Essential Discovery Tasks for Support Vector Machines', 'Demo: Building a Support Vector Machine Using the Default Settings', 'Improving the Support Vector Machine Model', 'Optimization Problem', 'Accounting for Errors with Nonlinearly Separable Data', 'Demo: Modifying the Methods of Solution Parameters', 'Optimizing the Complexity of the Support Vector Machine Model', 'Feature Space Approach for Nonlinearly Separable Data', 'Kernel Trick', 'Demo: Increasing the Flexibility of the Support Vector Machine', 'Model Interpretability', 'Demo: Adding Model Interpretability', 'Regularizing and Tuning the Hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine Model'], ['Introduction to Model Deployment', 'Essential Deployment Tasks', 'Selecting a Model', 'Numeric Measures of Model Performance', 'Confusion Matrix for Decision Predictions', 'ROC Charts and the C-Statistic', 'Charts Based on Response Rate: CPH and Lift', 'Ways of Comparing Models in Model Studio', 'Demo: Comparing Models within a Pipeline', 'Demo: Comparing Models across Pipelines', 'Demo: Exploring the Settings for Model Comparison and Selection', 'Scoring and Managing the Champion Model', 'Demo: Exploring the Features for Scoring and Managing a Model in Model Manager', 'Monitoring and Updating the Model']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 23 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Nothing practical to learn, not even temporary access to SAS...', 'Thank you SAS, Coursera, all involved to make this course available here.

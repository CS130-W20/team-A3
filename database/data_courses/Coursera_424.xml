Laney</course_instructor><course_introduction>Even decades into the Information Age, accounting practices yet fail to recognize the financial value of information. Moreover, traditional asset management practices fail to recognize information as an asset to be managed with earnest discipline. This has led to a business culture of complacence, and the inability for most organizations to fully leverage available information assets. 

This second course in the two-part Infonomics series explores how and why to adapt well-honed asset management principles and practices to information, and how to apply accepted and new valuation models to gauge informationâ€™s potential and realized economic benefits. In addition, the course will enlighten students on the critical but confounding issues of information ownership, property rights, and sovereignty. The course will wrap up with an overview of emergent roles for the information-savvy organization of the 21st century.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Business.Business Strategy</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Course Orientation//Module 1 Managing Information as an Asset//Module 2: Measuring and Accounting for Information//Module 3 Privacy, Rights, Ownership, and Sovereignty//Module 4 Roles and Organization Structure</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Overview', 'Meet Instructor Doug Laney'], ['1-1 Applied Ecosystem Concepts', '1-2 Applied Sustainability Concepts', '1-3 Information Supply Chain (And Networks?)', '1-4 Information Asset Activity Primitives', '1-5 Information Maturity Model', 'Traditional Asset Management Approaches Part 1', 'Traditional Asset Management Approaches Part 2', '1-7 Generally Accepted Information Principles', 'Interview with Andrew White', 'Interview with Mark Beyer (Supplemental)'], ['2-1 Why Measure and Value Information?', '2-2 Dimensions of Data Quality', '2-3 Introduction to Information Valuation Approaches', '2-4 Foundational Valuation Models for Information Assets', '2-5 Financial Valuation Models for Information Assets', '2-6 Juxtaposing and Combining Valuation Models', '2-7 Information on the Balance Sheet?', 'Interview with James Price'], ['3-1 Key Legal Concerns and Questions about Information', '3-2 Data Ownership and the Law', '3-3 The Asset Properties of Information', '3-4 Owning the Usage of Information', '3-5 The Ownership of Personal Information', '3-6 Internal Information Owners'], ['4-1 Fresh Hot Roles for the Info-Savvy Organization', '4-2 Emerging Roles for Monetizing Information', '4-3 Emerging Roles for Managing Information as an Asset', '4-4 Emerging Roles for Measuring Information as an Asset', '4-4 Infonomics Course Wrap-Up']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 12 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Great course!

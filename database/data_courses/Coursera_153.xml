It has applications in many industries such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, face detection in law enforcement agencies. In this beginner-friendly course you will understand about computer vision, and will learn about its various applications across many industries.

As part of this course you will utilize Python, Watson AI, and OpenCV to process images and interact with image classification models. You will also build, train, and test your own custom image classifiers. 

This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. All the labs will be performed on the Cloud and you will be provided access to a Cloud environment completely free of charge. At the end of the course, you will create your own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud.

This course does not require any prior Machine Learning or Computer Vision experience, however some knowledge of Python programming language is necessary.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag>Artificial Intelligence (AI)//Opencv//Computer Vision//watson</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>IBM</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Computer Vision//Image Classification with IBM Watson //Custom Classifiers with Watson Visual Recognition//Image Processing using IBM Watson and Python//Face Detection and Image Processing using OpenCV and Python//Project: Building a Web-Based Computer Vision App</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Introduction to Computer Vision', 'Introduction to Computer Vision', 'Applications of Computer Vision', 'Recent Research in Computer Vision', 'Brainstorming Your Own Applications'], ['Image Classification with IBM Watson', 'Watson Visual Recognition in Action', 'Getting Started with Watson Visual Recognition', 'Classification with Watson Visual Recognition', 'Working with Custom Classifiers', 'Custom Image Classifiers with IBM Watson'], ['Create, Train and Test a Visual Recognition Model', 'Classifying with Negative Examples', 'Retrain a Visual Recognition Model with Negative Images'], ['Introduction on Using the Watson APIs', 'Using Watson Visual Recognition', 'Applications of Watson Visual Recognition', 'Using the Watson VR API with Python'], ['Getting Started with OpenCV in Python', 'Detecting Faces with Cascade Filters', 'Detecting Eyes with Cascade Filters'], ['Project: How to deploy your VR Classifier', 'Instruction for Obtaining your API Key']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 13 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Great introduction to Visual Recognition and Computer Vision!

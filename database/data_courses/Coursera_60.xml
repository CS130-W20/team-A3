Absolutely loved all the lessons, quiz and reading material. I am motivated to continue through the rest of the courses in this specialization. ', 'I audited the course, so take that as you will, but:', "It is a good intro for somebody like myself with no background. An entire section was dedicated to getting a job in the field which wasn't useful for me. The course is also 4 years old, and while much of the reading is new, I wish it focused more on tactics and less on the history of search (another whole section). ", "I really liked how the course is able to insert someone that doesn't know anything about SEO into the right path, I been searching for a course like this a lot time ago and I'm happy to found it.", 'I think you should focus more in SEO basics and not so much in jobs, history and things like that.', 'Interesting, but too generic. Without proceeding in the following courses, this one is totally unuseful. Conversely, if you want to have a deep learning about SEO, this could be a great introduction to this wide world', 'Some interesting history on SEO. Too much on getting employed as an SEO professional.', 'A lot of unrelated information for an introduction in the 1st 2 modules.', 'Teaching Quality Is Very Low, Information is also lacked, By The Way Tutor words are not understable. ', "It's somewhat harder to learn information and retain it when the speaker is stumbling over their content. Additionally, there are ways to show SEO optimization in a more interactive way. I think this course could be improved with a more thoughtful look at the content. ", "Although informative, this course is dated... SEO courses should be updated with new information every 3 months.  Additionally, this course focuses on history and career information.. but I feel the career information should come in the 4th course for this speciality.  How would someone even know if they're interested in an SEO career before they've delved into it?", 'Lectures are far too short, and for some reason follow the "tell them what you\'re going to say, say it, then tell them what you said" approach. Yeah, not necessary when the "lecture" is only 1 minute long. The course would be 10 minutes shorter if they just did lectures like every other lecturer.', 'Course lacks real example and full of theory.  It lacks steps of what actually needs to be done to achieve SEO.', 'An evaluation is always tied to the value it provides in relation to the paid price. ', 'As a web developer, I found that I already knew about 98% of the information presented. The final 2% I could have found faster via a Google search than by watching the lectures. It was also a little strange to me that the course began with a segment on job opportunities and how to begin a career in SEO. I feel this would have made more sense after an introduction to the material.', 'Please review the transcriptions, there are mistakes.', 'Chapter 1 &amp; 2 are mainly dedicated for SEO careers. ', 'The first course in this specialize should really be called "a history of SEO." Only the week 4 material had the material that you are seeking to learn about. ', 'Outdated links and content. ', 'It provides a broad overview, but materials are not very refined and the course does not provide a good structured approach to the subject. At least it did not for me, leaving me wondering as to what next steps could be if I wanted to explore further.', None, "Unfortunately, this wasn't what I expected from the course. Maybe since I didn't take specialization but I feel that this course was too theoretical. I understand the history of SEO but I'm not confident how useful it'll be in real-life/commercial sense.", 'Great work', 'I was overwhelmed with the detailed introduction to the SEO field, market, job and history. I feel much more comfortable now and even discovered new resources for researching and learning. Awesome!', 'Great to be part of this course.............................................................................................................................']</reviews><reviewers>['By vedika j', 'By Jessa B', 'By Richard B', 'By jose t l', 'By MÃ³nica A', 'By Michele B', 'By Christine K', 'By Ibrahim A K', 'By VIKAS T', 'By Luke G', 'By Christine O', 'By Lee M B', 'By Christine D', 'By Roberto R', 'By Halliday H', 'By Laura  T d M C', 'By Christophe V N T', 'By Elean M', 'By Brooke L', 'By Alessio T', 'By alex g m', 'By Kumar D', 'By Mouad R', 'By Andrei F C', 'By Bhupinder S G']</reviewers><review_date>['Feb 18, 2019', 'Jan 29, 2018', 'Feb 28, 2019', 'Mar 07, 2018', 'Dec 12, 2017', 'Oct 29, 2017', 'Feb 19, 2019', 'May 02, 2019', 'May 23, 2019', 'Oct 21, 2018', 'Sep 06, 2017', 'Jul 10, 2017', 'Apr 06, 2017', 'Mar 29, 2016', 'Feb 17, 2016', 'Mar 28, 2019', 'Jun 21, 2019', 'Oct 08, 2018', 'Sep 17, 2017', 'Sep 26, 2016', 'May 19, 2016', 'Feb 13, 2016', 'Dec 04, 2018', 'Dec 19, 2018', 'Dec 19, 2018']</review_date></doc>

Inferential statistics help us decide, for example, whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general, in the entire population.

We will start by considering the basic principles of significance testing: the sampling and test statistic distribution, p-value, significance level, power and type I and type II errors. Then we will consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs. For each individual statistical test we will consider how it works, for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted. You will also learn how to perform these tests using freely available software. 

For those who are already familiar with statistical testing: We will look at z-tests for 1 and 2 proportions,  McNemar's test for dependent proportions, t-tests for 1 mean (paired differences) and 2 means, the Chi-square test for independence, Fisher’s exact test, simple regression (linear and exponential) and multiple regression (linear and logistic), one way and factorial analysis of variance, and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, sign test,  signed-rank test, runs test).</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Probability and Statistics</course_category><course_tag>Statistics//Statistical Inference//Regression Analysis//Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA)</course_tag><course_rating>4.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Amsterdam</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Before we get started...//Comparing two groups//Categorical association//Simple regression//Multiple regression//Analysis of variance//Non-parametric tests//Exam time!</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Inferential Statistics!'], ['1.01 Null hypothesis testing', '1.02 P-values', '1.03 Confidence intervals and two-sided tests', '1.04 Power', '1.05 Two independent proportions', '1.06 Two independent means', '1.07 Two dependent proportions', '1.08 Two dependent means', '1.09 Controlling for other variables'], ['2.01 Categorical association and independence', '2.02  The Chi-squared test', '2.03 Interpreting the Chi-squared test', '2.04 Chi-squared as goodness-of-fit', '2.05 The Chi-squared test - sidenotes', "2.06 Fisher's exact test"], ['3.01 The regression line', '3.02 The regression equation', '3.03 The regression model', '3.04 Predictive power', '3.05 Pitfalls in regression', '3.06 Testing the model', '3.07 Checking assumptions', '3.08 CI and PI for predicted values', '3.09 Exponential regression'], ['4.01 Regression model', '4.02 R and R-squared', '4.03 Overall test', '4.04 Individual tests', '4.05 Checking assumptions', '4.06 Categorical predictors', '4.07 Categorical response variable', '4.08 Interpreting results'], ['5.01 One-way ANOVA', '5.02 One-way ANOVA - Assumptions and F-test', '5.03 One-way ANOVA - Post-hoc t-tests', '5.04 Factorial ANOVA', '5.05  Factorial ANOVA - Assumptions and tests', '5.06 ANOVA and regression'], ['6.01 Non-parametric tests - Why and when', '6.02 The sign test', '6.03 One sample - Wilcoxon signed rank test', '6.04 Two samples - Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney test', '6.05 Several samples - Kruskal-Wallis test', '6.06 Spearman correlation', '6.07 The runs test'], ['Practice exam', 'Final exam']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 42 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Week 1 to Week 5 were well explained, however the quality of the videos declined steadily to the end of the module. Many inconsistencies between video - audio - written text. ', 'For someone who is not familiar with inferential statistics, this course is too compact. I lost the overall picture: it seems that a dozend methods were introduced, but I failed to understand under which preconditions each method is deployable. I am confused. ', "This course is awesome on so many levels. This is the best inferential statistics course I've come across. Here's why: ", 'This course was relatively difficult for my slow brain. I learned A LOT. but I still feel the need for doing this course one more time', "I don't feel the videos were sufficient enough to teach the methods for working through the formulas or to efficiently identify which scenario a certain formula was to be applied. The quiz instructions were vague and it was extremely difficult to know exactly what was being asked or which formula to apply. Often I had to result in giving my best guess. Forums were not helpful. Most questions were two years old or a few months old at the earliest and answers were not helpful. This course is especially confusing for beginners. I don't see how people have actually been able to learn from this course. With Basic Statistics course I at least felt I got a good basic understanding of the material. This course went miles over my head.", 'Terrible confusing questions in final... never take this if you are a beginner!', "I found the course was very confusing and the language used in the quizzes and exams didn't always match the language used in the lessons making it very difficult to understand what was wanted.", 'Thanks', None, "Completing this course requires perseverence but it is 100% worth it. There's a lot of material covered and the videos simply provide signposts for the topics but one doesn't learn statistics by watching videos. The real learning takes place during quizzes and assignments. The final exam is time consuming and tough and students need to truly master the material to earn a high grade.", "Incredibly dense (which they warn you about) so the lecutres fly over so much important info it's hard to keep track of even with a strong focus. A very good overview though. ", 'Hopelessly fast, compared to the excellent Basic Statistics by the same team. I gave up in week 1.', 'This course is very helpful for people intereted in quantitative research', 'wonderful', None, 'Quite difficult but amazing!', 'great course', 'I have learned a lot from this course. Thanks', 'Excellent Course for Inferential Statistics and Regression Analysis', 'Very interesting but challenging course in Inferential Statistics.', 'Very good explanation of the given topics!', 'Hi, I enjoyed really well and this very good course on Inferential Statistics. My experience was really good. Thank you for providing the course for free! ', 'One of the better Statistical Inference courses out there.', 'Un super curso , excelente  y felicitaciones por vuestro gran trabajo, pero es muy triste no poder disfrutar al 100% un curso de esta calidad traducido en el idioma español, les pido por favor si fueran tan gentiles de acceder a esta humilde petición, gracias por anticipado y nuevamente felicitaciones.', 'Very carefully presented and organized introductory course. Well put R support.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Ute T', 'By Markus W', 'By Do H L', 'By Zainab H', 'By Grace L', 'By Sara J', 'By Scott A H', 'By ahmed s a', 'By Muhammad A R', 'By Arman B K', 'By Nicholas D', 'By Jo S', 'By gerardo r g', 'By norbert b', 'By Benjamin H', 'By EDILSON S S O J', 'By Victor C', 'By Md Y A', 'By Santanu G', 'By Abdirahman M', 'By Laurenz R', 'By Pankaj A', 'By Vikram S', 'By Gregorio A A P', 'By Ivan R P']</reviewers><review_date>['Mar 13, 2019', 'May 15, 2016', 'Sep 03, 2016', 'Oct 25, 2018', 'Jul 08, 2018', 'May 16, 2019', 'Jan 03, 2017', 'Jul 26, 2016', 'Dec 28, 2018', 'Nov 13, 2018', 'Feb 13, 2018', 'Mar 08, 2016', 'Dec 04, 2018', 'Aug 07, 2018', 'Jul 27, 2018', 'May 09, 2016', 'Mar 06, 2016', 'Jan 18, 2018', 'Jun 07, 2017', 'Feb 16, 2018', 'Oct 22, 2017', 'Jul 04, 2017', 'Jan 28, 2017', 'Jul 07, 2017', 'May 27, 2016']</review_date></doc>

Wiley, PhD</course_instructor><course_introduction>This course will prepare you to complete all parts of the Clinical Data Science Specialization. In this course you will learn how clinical data are generated, the format of these data, and the ethical and legal restrictions on these data. You will also learn enough SQL and R programming skills to be able to complete the entire Specialization - even if you are a beginner programmer. While you are taking this course you will have access to an actual clinical data set and a free, online computational environment for data science hosted by our Industry Partner Google Cloud. 

At the end of this course you will be prepared to embark on your clinical data science education journey, learning how to take data created by the healthcare system and improve the health of tomorrow's patients.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Colorado System</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Welcome to the Clinical Data Science Specialization//Introduction: Clinical Data//Tools: SQL//Tools: R and the Tidyverse</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Introduction to Clinical Data Science', 'Introduction to Clinical Data Science', 'Clinical Data Regulations', 'Introduction to the MIMIC-III Data Set'], ['Introduction to Clinical Data', 'Encounters', 'Billing Data', 'Laboratory Data', 'Medication Data', 'Clinical Observation Data', 'Demographics, Social and Family History'], ['Introduction to Databases', 'Querying Tables with SQL', 'Joining Tables with SQL', 'Aggregating Data with SQL', 'Introduction to Google BigQuery'], ['Introduction to R and the Tidyverse', 'Introduction to RStudio']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 10 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['very good course.Introduce me to EHR. Refresh on my SQL. And nice programming enviormnemt. Week 4 video could be more. R part is a bit weak.', 'The class teaches a great combination of industry clinical data models concepts and sample data sets, access to cloud-based Bigquery from Google and RStudio, progressive coding exercises bringing it all together.', 'Great introduction to fundamental concepts. May be challenging for those without any prior experience  in SQL or R. ', 'Easy to understand, very professional and studying material is clear and relevant. I definitely recommend this course to jump into the clinical and healthcare data science world.', "The material is presented very clearly, and exercises are easy to understand and complete but really test one's knowledge of the material.", "I really enjoyed this course very much.  I'm hoping completing the Clinical Data Science Specialty will give me enough experience with medical data so that I can get a job as a Medical Data Analyst or Data Warehouse/ETL developer for a medical company.", 'Very well organized! Explanations are good and detailed enough, most examples are helpful for understanding important concepts and acquiring essential skills and knowledge. I would strongly recommend this lecture to ones who are not in the medical/healthcare field, but need to work on clinical data. Thank you!', 'Great introduction to the clinical data science domain and toolsets', 'This is a good introductory course on Clinical Data Science. ', 'Good intro to the specialization. Learned a bit of R.', 'Great introductory course for aspiring clinical data scientists', 'Great introduction to clinical data science covering a range of topics such as informatics, SQL, data science, R and the R Tidyverse.', 'Enjoyed that the instructor took a Tidyverse orientation, and matched it with the SQL query work.  This connects two seemingly separate  coding skills, and makes both easier to learn and master in a highly practical -- real-world functional -- way.', 'I enjoyed this course. I felt the material presented was concise and easy to understand. ', 'Overall, good ! The introduction to R is confusing', 'I really enjoyed this class. I had to go slowly because I was busy, but it was just the right amount of information for me.', 'Nice course', 'I encourage people to take this course.', 'It was a nice starting point of R  for me.', 'A nice introduction!', "Great course! This course covers so much content in a condensed format without overwhelming the student. Great foundation for clinical data science. I'm looking forward to taking the subsequent courses!", 'excellent module with hands-on exercises and quiz.', 'Great intro and ability to build a base for early script writing.', 'Great introduction to Clinical Data Science which provides  you a bird view of how to prepare your mind and senses when you are tackle with the unknown of what to do and how to prepare your clinical data.

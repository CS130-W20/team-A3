First, you will learn how to filter a data set using different types of queries to find just the data you need to answer a particular question. Then, we will discuss simple yet powerful analysis methods that use vector data to find spatial relationships within and between data sets. In this section, you will also learn about how to use ModelBuilder, a simple but powerful tool for building analysis flowcharts that can then also be run as models. You will then learn how to find, understand, and use remotely sensed data such as satellite imagery, as a rich source of GIS data. You will then learn how to analyze raster data. Finally, you will complete your own project where you get to try out the new skills and tools you have learned about in this course.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Physical Science and Engineering.Environmental Science and Sustainability</course_category><course_tag>Geographic Information System (GIS)//Cartography//Esri//Mapping//Spatial Analysis</course_tag><course_rating>4.9</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Toronto</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Filtering Data Using Queries//Vector analysis//Remote sensing as a GIS data source//Raster analysis//Project: Spatial Analysis</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to the course!', 'Interactive selection in ArcMap', 'Select by attribute', 'Queries and Venn diagrams', 'Select by location', 'Select by attribute and location in ArcMap', 'Mixing attribute and location queries', 'Reclassification and aggregation'], ['Vector buffers', 'Raster distances', 'Ian McHarg', 'Vector intersection and union', 'Constraint analysis', 'Areal interpolation', 'Spatial join', 'ArcToolbox introduction', 'What is geoprocessing?', 'ModelBuilder example', 'Getting started with ModelBuilder'], ['What is remote sensing?', 'Spatial resolution of satellite images', 'Temporal resolution of satellite sensors', 'Radiometric resolution of satellite sensors', 'Spectral resolution of satellite sensors', 'Spatial vs. spectral resolution', 'Spectral signatures of land cover types', 'Displaying multiband satellite images', 'Landsat Explorer web app introduction', 'Working with satellite imagery in ArcMap', 'The image analysis window in ArcMap', 'Downloading Landsat 8 data', 'Adding Landsat 8 images to ArcMap', 'Visually interpreting satellite images', 'Satellite image classification'], ['Raster zones and regions', 'Raster mask and NoData cells', 'Local raster operators', 'Map algebra: calculating NDVI', 'Raster reclassification', 'Raster Boolean overlay', 'Focal raster operators', 'Zonal raster operators', 'Global raster operators', 'Raster weighted overlay', 'Mosaic and aggregate tools'], ['$null$']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 16 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>["\nI recommend this course for anyone who want to learn more about GIS and ESRI ArcMap. Professor's explanations are clear and understandable, although the topic is not so easy. Students get one year software licence for the best tool and necessary knowledge.", 'Helped me with practical knowledge.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Jasminka K', 'By Md A M P']</reviewers><review_date>['Jun 17, 2019', 'Jun 26, 2019']</review_date></doc>

Several basic examples are given to get the flavor of the applications: fitting rectangles to be applied for printing posters, scheduling problems, solving puzzles, and program correctness. Also underlying theory is presented: resolution as a basic approach for propositional satisfiability, the CDCL framework to scale up for big formulas, and the simplex method to deal with linear inequallities.

The light weight approach to following this course is just watching the lectures and do the corresponding quizzes. To get a flavor of the topic this may work out fine. However, the much more interesting approach is to use this as a basis to apply SAT/SMT yourself on several problems, for instance on the problems presented in the honor's assignment.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Computer Science.Algorithms</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.8</course_rating><course_orgnization>EIT Digital </course_orgnization><course_chapter>SAT/SMT basics, SAT examples//SMT applications//Theory and algorithms for CNF-based SAT//Theory and algorithms for SAT/SMT</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['General introduction, and an application to poster printing', 'Introduction to SAT', 'SMT syntax and tools', 'Eight queens problem', 'Binary Arithmetic: addition', 'Binary Arithmetic: multiplication'], ['Rectangle fitting', 'Solving Sudoku', 'Scheduling', 'Bounded model checking'], ['Resolution', 'Example of resolution', 'DPLL', 'Transforming DPLL to resolution', 'CDCL basics', 'CDCL optimizations'], ['Transforming a propositional formula to CNF', 'The Tseitin transfomation', 'Introduction to the Simplex method', 'Optimizing by the Simplex method', 'Checking feasibility by the Simplex method', 'The Simplex method and SMT']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 11 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['This was a great introductory course for satisfiability. I strongly recommend you to solve all the honorary problems because they were so useful for thorough understanding.', 'The course explains the fundamental concepts very clearly. It is very helpful to understand the basic concepts of SMT solvers', 'Good course, but some quizes are a bit confusing :)']</reviews><reviewers>['By Jaewoo S', 'By santosh s', 'By Khazam']</reviewers><review_date>['Jul 19, 2019', 'Aug 02, 2019', 'Aug 17, 2019']</review_date></doc>

This course will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications. The course will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag>Random Forest//Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms//Machine Learning//R Programming</course_tag><course_rating>4.5</course_rating><course_orgnization>Johns Hopkins University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Week 1: Prediction, Errors, and Cross Validation//Week 2: The Caret Package//Week 3: Predicting with trees, Random Forests, &amp; Model Based Predictions//Week 4: Regularized Regression and Combining Predictors</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Prediction motivation', 'What is prediction?', 'Relative importance of steps', 'In and out of sample errors', 'Prediction study design', 'Types of errors', 'Receiver Operating Characteristic', 'Cross validation', 'What data should you use?'], ['Caret package', 'Data slicing', 'Training options', 'Plotting predictors', 'Basic preprocessing', 'Covariate creation', 'Preprocessing with principal components analysis', 'Predicting with Regression', 'Predicting with Regression Multiple Covariates'], ['Predicting with trees', 'Bagging', 'Random Forests', 'Boosting', 'Model Based Prediction'], ['Regularized regression', 'Combining predictors', 'Forecasting', 'Unsupervised Prediction']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 14 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['It needs to be updated. Its probably one of the most in demand skills in the field and this has a weeks worth of content 1 section 25 minutes of video 5 questions. Its just not as good as any of the other courses. 100% needs to be revamped. ', 'More practice Items are needed', 'Lectures and course material is insufficient to get the right amount of knowledge to be able to do the tests and the course project', 'Unsatisfactory and poor course in this specialisation. There are many important parts which are explained inaccurately. In many cases, the lecturer jumps from important points, or assumes students have detailed knowledge about the topic. You can find ambiguity in weekly questions. Very unsatisfied!', 'The worst course of the specialisation so far. The quizzes are full of typos, not clear at all, and the videos teach nothing, always refering to elements of statistical learning book. Now that I have completed the course, I do know a bunch of algorithm names involved in machine learning, but I certainly do not understand what they do and when using them.', 'The lectures and quizzes are based on old versions of R and R packages. This course needs a serious update, as some packages work differently, test answers have changed (but not been updated) and coding along with the videos results in different results. Going to the forum you can see that this has been an issue for a few years now.', 'By far the laziest course set up in the track. It\'s an interesting topic, but without independent study I would have learned almost nothing due to the lack of any "practicals" in this "Practical Machine Learning". A really disappointing course that fails to be worth more than just a couple hours of youtube.', "Worst lectures! Worst teaching! I leanrt most of the topics on statquest. Very very very highlevel teaching, very little effort put in by Bcaffo and Rdpeng on this! So many issues in the quizzes. Wasted hours on puzzling out what is to be done! Have a look at the complaints in the course era discussion board. Issues since 3 years are not corrected. The course needs an update. But no m*****F**** is listening. Solutions to  quizze are wrong! I have had it with coursera and their useles peer correction. You don't even know if what you are doing is right!  Worst FEEDBACK ever!", "That's a pretty rushed course. I think you really should reformulate it and discuss its content with a deeper way.", 'lecture material could be cleaner with fewer errors', 'I was rather disappointed with this course. I guess it fills the objective of getting you using the caret package and getting you started with some examples. However to understand what you are doing you should defintively go somewhere else. I definitively missed some swirl exercises and more flow diagrams in the slides. It felt for me as I was just copypasting some code from the slides. The course does clearly give some good literature and places to go for details.', 'Not enough context for the price payed ', 'I\'m a big fan of the John\'s Hopkins Data Science series on Coursera; however, they definitely "phoned it in" on this particular course.  No practical assignments except for the quizzes and final course project.  Too much deference to outside materials, i.e. if you really want to learn these concepts take Andrew Ng\'s class or read The Elements of Statistical Learning.  The video lectures just breeze over the concepts and leave too much for the learner to just go and figure out.  The quizzes, instead of testing your knowledge are literal the only practical learning in whole class.  The course project is what you make of it.  ', "Extremely confusing. Should look at Prof. Andrew Ng's machine learning course for how to clearly convey an idea.", "This course was a big let-down compared to other courses in the specialization.  It doesn't seem like a lot of effort went into course planning and creation.  Much of the content is unclear and there is little depth.   course textbook, and some swirl exercises would have helped.", 'Wonderful course and instructor, it was the best in the specialization courses so far.', 'A very good course giving brief descriptions and applications of some of the used statistical and machine learning algorithms.', 'Introductory course but it explains the basics easily ', 'nice pace, good overview to start with modelling in R', 'This is the most interesting of all the courses in this specialization. Sometimes the content covered can be overwhelming. But the end result in the form of project assignment is worth all the efforts.', 'This was one of my favorite courses in the specialization as it was so easy to understand and follow. I think the basis I was given has really made me want to delve deeper into the topic and apply it to my career. Thank you!!!', 'great course in R, really covers the fundamentals.', 'Very informative', 'Very good course. Clear explanations and examples give a good overview of the foundations of Machine Learning. After this course the student can build Machine Learning models.', 'a quick introduction to the basic algorithms for machine learning in R']</reviews><reviewers>['By Bernie P', 'By Jean P L', 'By Thomas B', 'By Hamid M ', 'By Grégoire M', 'By Andrew C', 'By Thomas G', 'By Thej K R', 'By Erick G A', 'By David S', 'By Humberto R', 'By Mariana d S e S', 'By Wayne H', 'By Lingjian K', 'By Bob W', 'By Mohammad A', 'By Avizit C A', 'By Sanjeev  K', 'By Julien N', 'By Anuj P', 'By Dave H', 'By Dewald O', 'By Mahmoud E', 'By João F', 'By Bruno R d C S']</reviewers><review_date>['Aug 07, 2018', 'Apr 25, 2018', 'Nov 08, 2018', 'Feb 21, 2018', 'Sep 27, 2017', 'May 14, 2019', 'Jun 07, 2017', 'Jun 04, 2019', 'Aug 18, 2017', 'Dec 18, 2018', 'Feb 13, 2018', 'Mar 01, 2018', 'Jun 27, 2017', 'Jun 14, 2017', 'Apr 09, 2017', 'Jan 17, 2019', 'Jan 31, 2019', 'Dec 16, 2018', 'Dec 18, 2018', 'Feb 21, 2019', 'Feb 23, 2019', 'Feb 24, 2019', 'Feb 25, 2019', 'Feb 14, 2019', 'Mar 07, 2019']</review_date></doc>

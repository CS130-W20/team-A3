They will use a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners  will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.
Learning Outcomes:
•	determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation
•	know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem 
•	master the process of creating  a deep learning pipeline 
•	apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data
•	demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>IBM</course_orgnization><course_chapter /><course_sub_chapter>[]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Advanced Level</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

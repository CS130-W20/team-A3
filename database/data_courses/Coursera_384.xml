Sobel</course_instructor><course_introduction>This course offers a rigorous mathematical survey of advanced topics in causal inference at the Masterâ€™s level.

Inferences about causation are of great importance in science, medicine, policy, and business.  This course provides an introduction to the statistical literature on causal inference that has emerged in the last 35-40 years and that has revolutionized the way in which statisticians and applied researchers in many disciplines use data to make inferences about causal relationships.  

We will study advanced topics in causal inference, including mediation, principal stratification, longitudinal causal inference, regression discontinuity, interference, and fixed effects models.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Probability and Statistics</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating /><course_orgnization>Columbia University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Module 7: Introduction to Mediation//Module 8: More on Mediation//Module 9: Instrumental Variables, Principal Stratification, and Regression Discontinuity																										//Module 10: Longitudinal Causal Inference																										//Module 11: Interference and Fixed Effects																										</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to Causal Inference 2', 'Lesson 1: Mediation and Conditioning on Intermediate Outcomes', 'Lesson 2: Reframing the Problem of Mediation', 'Lesson 3: Identification of Controlled, Average Direct and Indirect Effects'], ['Lesson 1: Estimation of Mediated Effects', 'Lesson 2: Sensitivity Analyses for Mediation', 'Lesson 3: Instrumental Variables with a Continuous Treatment'], ['Lesson 1: Instrumental Variables and the Complier Average Causal Effect', 'Lesson 2: Principal Stratification', 'Lesson 3: Regression Discontinuity'], ['Lesson 1: The g-formula', 'Lesson 2: Marginal Structural Models', 'Lesson 3: Structural Nested Mean Models and g-estimation'], ['Lesson 1: Introduction to Interference', 'Lesson 2: Interference Continued', 'Lesson 3: Fixed Effects Regressions in Econometrics']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 13 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

You'll begin this course by building a foundation of essential aggregation knowledge. By understanding these features of the Aggregation Framework you will learn how to ask complex questions of your data. This will lay the groundwork for the remainder of the course where you'll dive deep and learn about schema design, relational data migrations, and machine learning with 
MongoDB.

By the end of this course you'll understand how to best use MongoDB and its Aggregation Framework in your own data science workflow.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>MongoDB Inc.</course_orgnization><course_chapter>The Fundamentals of MongoDB Aggregation//Leveraging MongoDB's Flexible Schema//Machine Learning with MongoDB</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome!', 'Course Logistics and Prerequisites', 'Aggregation Introduction', 'The Concept of Pipelines', 'Aggregation Structure and Syntax', '$match: Filtering Documents', 'Using $project', 'Using Expressions', 'Cursor Like Methods Stages: Part 1', 'Cursor Like Methods Stages: Part 2', 'The $group Stage', 'Using Accumulator Expressions', '$unwind', 'The $lookup Stage', '$graphLookup Stage'], ['Intro to Week 2', 'mongoimport', 'Importance of Schema', 'Exploring Schemas', 'Migrating Your Schema', 'Views', 'Supplementing Schemas with Accumulators', 'Tree-like Data in Individual Documents (Part 1)', 'Tree-like Data in Individual Documents (Part 2)', 'Expressive Lookup Basics', 'Entity Resolution with $lookup'], ['Intro to Week 3', 'Calculation of Persons-Rho', 'Intro: Associative Role Learning', 'Principal Component Analysis (Part 1)', 'Principal Component Analysis (Part 2)', 'Intro to Linear Regressions', 'Linear Regressions with MongoDB', 'Decision Trees Part 1', 'Decision Trees Part 2', 'Decision Trees Part 3', 'Intro to Clustering Algorithms']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 20 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Very helpful for core basics to get started', 'good course', 'Very clear introduction to the MongoDB Aggregation Framework. Interesting and comprehensive data analysis examples as well!', 'Overall a good course. Some of the labs could be more intuitive and in one (I gave some feedback in the comments) has IMHO so false datasource. I also think that especially in Week3 some labs have to much information given and the student only has to do some minor tasks. ', "The first two weeks are a good introduction to Aggregation and what you can do with it. The third week is more focused on using Mongo in machine learning applications and teaches you less new Mongo content and isn't in depth enough to be a good introduction to machine learning, but is a good way to get familiar with using the tools you've been shown earlier in the course. Some of the exercises are a little unclear in their wording but the course administrators are quick to reply in the forums and they update the workbooks in response to feedback. Overall would recommend to anyone who will be using Mongo and wants to get an overview of it's capabilities and some practise putting it into action.", 'The course was excellent, but there were some problems: - There were mistakes in some assignments codes. - Some codes mentioned in the lectures were not available in resources.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Diana S', 'By BOWEN Z', 'By Zhehui Z', 'By Bernd L', 'By Andrew M', 'By Nahid T']</reviewers><review_date>['Dec 14, 2018', 'Jun 30, 2019', 'Sep 10, 2019', 'Aug 12, 2018', 'Aug 23, 2018', 'Jul 13, 2019']</review_date></doc>

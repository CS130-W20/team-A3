MBSE is where the model resulting from the evolution of system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities is the focus of design and manufacturing. Students will gain an understanding of systems engineering, the model-based approach to design and manufacturing, the Digital Twin, and a roadmap toward a model-based enterprise.

Students will be able to explain the value and expectations of systems engineering and model-based systems engineering, and the underlying motivations and opportunities represented by a model-based enterprise. They will develop the knowledge necessary to perform a baseline assessment of an organization’s potential to leverage MBSE. 

Main concepts of this course will be delivered through lectures, readings, discussions and various videos. 

This is the eighth course in the Digital Manufacturing &amp; Design Technology specialization that explores the many facets of manufacturing’s “Fourth Revolution,”  aka Industry 4.0, and features a culminating project involving creation of a roadmap to achieve a self-established DMD-related professional goal.

It provides MBSE concept in very simple approach and also suggest how systematically we can assess the MBE practices in the organization and follow recommended  practices at different level to reach ultimate goal.', 'Very good and detailed introduction into world of systems engineering. Tons of helpful resources and theory material. Ispirational and insightful!', 'G', 'Gives a clear idea about MBSE covering basics of all the major fields related to MBSE and MBE. Also, informs about self assessment tool and various levels of assessment during complete life cycle. ', 'Good course', 'THE COURSE IS AWESOME', 'A course that deals with the fundamentals of an Engineering System, through the implementation of strategies with practical examples, applications and tools of use until reaching the level of maturity. Complete!', 'E', 'Highly recommended course about model based systems. A must for mechanical and industrial engineers', 'Very useful and very detailed course. I think this course the best in DMD specialization. ', 'Brief but complete view of MBSE with lot of helpful additional resources.', 'thank you for the course', 'hi fi', 'This course gives the introduction and overview on the Model Based System Engineering concepts and very helpful for a beginner. The evaluation quizzes mark wrong for the correct answers and I would like to know the reason for the same.', 'I acquired good insights on the concepts of systems engineering and MBSE.', 'The course content. It could have been more exiting, if we could add Model Based Analysis topic. ', 'Well structured and dense with good information.', 'very hard at first but it grows on you', 'The course had great information and was very well compacted to display that information in a concise manner.  I think Prof. English could have talked a little more extemporaneously.  It was clear he was reading from a cue card, which isn\'t a bad thing, for it kept the videos moving along and giving solid information, but the few moments where you could tell he was speaking from experience and not the cards added some color to the videos.  I also really enjoyed the "guest speaker" Prof. Long who was clearly a very knowledgeable professional on systems engineering and MBSE.  The final week 4 is basically going over the excel sheet provided by NIST in a line-by-line manner, so that could have been supplemented better with the videos, perhaps providing more actionable solutions or suggestions to integrating an MBE into a company.  GREAT COURSE, I LOVED IT!!', 'Interesting course. Maybe a little bit too long but nice. Some better visuals would improve the dynamism of the videos.', 'Pretty useful and simplified online material for MBSE! ', 'To less information about SysML and Effect Chains', 'It was more theoretical and less practical.I expected more of a real-time approach that can broaden my understanding MBSE. I was very basic.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Rabindranath R', 'By Yauehni B', 'By Alexandre S R d O', 'By Harsh K D', 'By yashar k s', 'By KWAME Y', 'By Wesley T', 'By David H', 'By Vancho D', 'By András T', 'By Txinto V', 'By Tejash y T G', 'By Adnan A', 'By Karthik C H', 'By Aravinth R', 'By Srimannarayana M', 'By Daniel Z', 'By mholi', 'By Sean M', 'By Guillaume C', 'By Muthusankar', 'By Andreas L ', 'By Yash K S']</reviewers><review_date>['Jan 16, 2019', 'Feb 09, 2019', 'Jan 31, 2019', 'Aug 03, 2018', 'Jun 02, 2018', 'Oct 19, 2017', 'May 02, 2018', 'Feb 21, 2018', 'Jan 26, 2018', 'May 08, 2018', 'Nov 09, 2017', 'Dec 05, 2018', 'Nov 03, 2017', 'Nov 08, 2017', 'Apr 29, 2018', 'Jul 27, 2018', 'Jul 30, 2018', 'Jun 27, 2019', 'Jul 24, 2019', 'Jul 28, 2019', 'Aug 23, 2019', 'Jan 25, 2019', 'Feb 19, 2019']</review_date></doc>

Surveys, transaction histories and billing records can all provide insight into consumersâ€™ future behavior, provided that they are interpreted correctly. In Introduction to Marketing Analytics, we introduce the tools that learners will need to convert raw data into marketing insights. The included exercises are conducted using Microsoft Excel, ensuring that learners will have the tools they need to extract information from the data available to them. The course provides learners with exposure to essential tools including exploratory data analysis, as well as regression methods that can be used to investigate the impact of marketing activity on aggregate data (e.g., sales) and on individual-level choice data (e.g., brand choices).

So either the course description didn't provide enough information for a non-statistician to realize it will get very complex, or the language and explanations should have been simplified/more descriptive for the audience. ", "There's barely enough content or involvement, here, to qualify this as a course. The video lessons drill in on incredibly simple concepts while breezing right over complex terms, formulas, and practical knowledge which is then tested. There are very few reference documents. There are no ways to cross-reference our methodology/problem solving in excel.", 'I love this course.', 'love this course', 'This course is a must for anyone who is serious about learning about data driven marketing and gleaning practical insights.', 'The last 2 video lectures: Customer Valuation Excel Demonstration and Inventory Management Excel Demonstrationm were very well explained and taught me something new and useful.', 'Great content. The hands-on approach and the use of actual tools with basic software are just great.', None, 'Excellent course! Very hands on with right level of theory and application. Prof. Schweidel is obviously an expert in this field. ', 'This course provided practical hands-on approach to understanding basics of marketing forecasting. ', 'This course went in depth into some excel functions used for analyzing sales and marketing data, really thought it was useful. ', 'an excellent start to marketing analytics', 'Really enjoyed the class. I like that the examples and data files were on topics that someone in marketing might use in their daily work.', 'Helpful, practical assignments and tutorials.', 'Useful and Insightful', "It is a very good structured entry level course to marketing analytics for professionals who have some Excel skills but don't know where to start. It's the first part of a 6-course pack and I look forward to start the rest asap. I strongly recommend.", 'Excellent lectures and content throughout the course.  ', "One of the best courses on analytics. You will use excel, real data, and your own insights. It's a package.", 'Good learning experience', 'The content is extremely valuable and was delivered in a very good way fully engaging the learners! ', 'Some notions introduced too fast and with little explanations. Overall very interesting and applicable.', 'Great content and examples. Sometimes, the theoretical background could be explained more comprehensively in the lectures.', 'I would have liked more discussion of theory behind what the formulas were and, actually, using slicers for data so that clients couldn\'t "break" the file unintentionally. Otherwise, it was a good basic course, a little too dependent on showing Excel rather than saying why something worked (IF clauses are a good example here, cutting and pasting formulas is not as helpful to my personal learning style as just explaining the rationale behind them.) ', 'It was an amazing course. But i found some of the statistical models difficult to understand so needed to go back and review my statistics a bit to grapple with it. Overall, a brilliant course.', 'I wish solutions for probabilities related questions were very detailed, for people who are still learning statistics, or forgot.

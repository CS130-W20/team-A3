First you will learn user-user collaborative filtering, an algorithm that identifies other people with similar tastes to a target user and combines their ratings to make recommendations for that user.  You will explore and implement variations of the user-user algorithm, and will explore the benefits and drawbacks of the general approach.  Then you will learn the widely-practiced item-item collaborative filtering algorithm, which identifies global product associations from user ratings, but uses these product associations to provide personalized recommendations based on a user's own product ratings.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Machine Learning</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Minnesota</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Preface//User-User Collaborative Filtering Recommenders Part 1//User-User Collaborative Filtering Recommenders Part 2//Item-Item Collaborative Filtering Recommenders Part 1//Item-Item Collaborative Filtering Recommenders Part 2//Advanced Collaborative Filtering Topics</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Introduction'], ['User-User Collaborative Filtering', 'Configuring User-User Collaborative Filtering', 'Influence Limiting and Attack Resistance; Interview with Paul Resnick', 'Trust-Based Recommendation; Interview with Jen Golbeck', 'Impact of Bad Ratings; Interview with Dan Cosley'], ['Assignment Introduction', 'Programming Assignment - Programming User-User Collaborative Filtering'], ['Introduction to Item-Item Collaborative Filtering', 'Item-Item Algorithm', 'Item-Item on Unary Data', 'Item-Item Hybrids and Extensions', 'Strengths and Weaknesses of Item-Item Collaborative Filtering', 'Interview with Brad Miller'], ['Item-Based CF Assignment Intro Video', 'Programming Assignment - Programming Item-Item Collaborative Filtering'], ['The Cold Start Problem', 'Recommending for Groups:  Interview with Anthony Jameson', 'Threat Models', 'Explanations', 'Explanations, Part II:  Interview with Nava Tintarev']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 12 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['It would be better to provide other programming language such as python in honour assignment.

', 'There is an error in the assignment week 4 : the spreadsheet normalize by user instead of by item', "The course is less helpful than the others in the specialty.  The lecture should include an example to help clarify the understanding necessary for Quiz Part II and Part IV.   The instructors didn't respond to the many questions in Week 4 forum and I was unable to complete the course.

It would be great if the assignments are created on python or R in the next season's offering. Thanks for the knowledge!", 'Awesome as always, Joe and Michael rock. The interview with Brad Miller was stellar, felt like listening to the legends of rock-n-roll!', 'Very good course, there is a glaring error in Week 4s assignment. But if you check the forums it can be easily solved', 'Provides a good overview of item based and user based collaborative filtering approaches. ', 'a great class, I learned some insight in these algorithms', 'Exercises take time but really helpful.', None, 'Great course, nice theory and interesting exercise with the sheets and making actual Java programs to implement the algorithms. I would love to see some more in-depth probability theory, and considerations about when the algorithms deviate from the theory, or connections to other theories, but I suppose the course is more accessible and interesting like this. The interviews are probably my favorite part!', 'in-depth and well-made to follow', 'Loved it...many thanks Prof. Joe for bringing this content to Coursera', 'Awesome Professors!Great Material.Very thankful to Coursera for providing this course.', 'very nice', 'All in all, it is a comprehensive introduction to collaborative filtering. It allows the reader which paradigms and what tools to use in specific situations. I still have some complains with the excel assignments though.', 'I love it. Would be cool to be able download all materials in one big .zip file (e.g for searching using grep) ;-)', 'Very satisfied to do this, the videos are too long, very good quality and a lot of practical information.', 'everything best. But technical support in Forum and when a student needs help when he is learning in Vienna alone is the worst', 'Great learning experience about collaborative filtering!', 'Nice course!

You will plan out your project by writing a brief proposal that explains what you plan to do and why. You will then find data for a topic and location of your choice, and perform analysis and create maps that allow you to try out different tools and data sets. The results of your work will be assembled into an Esri story map, which is a web site with maps, images, text, and video. The goal is for you to have a finished product that you can share, and that demonstrates what you have learned.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Physical Science and Engineering.Environmental Science and Sustainability</course_category><course_tag>Geographic Information System (GIS)//Cartography//Esri//Mapping//Spatial Analysis</course_tag><course_rating>4.9</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Toronto</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Story Maps//Data Discovery and Project Proposal//Data Acquisition and Preparation//Spatial Analysis//Map Design//Story Map</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to the capstone project', 'Introduction to story maps', 'Building your first story map', 'Adding pop-ups to a story map'], ['Advice and guidelines for writing your proposal'], ['Evaluating data using metadata', 'Data dictionary', 'The importance of metadata', 'Viewing and editing metadata in ArcMap', 'Downloading and using GIS data', 'Adding x,y data from a table', 'Clipping a feature class', 'Merging feature classes', 'Interactive selection in ArcMap', 'Select by attribute', 'Queries and Venn diagrams', 'Select by location', 'Select by attribute and location in ArcMap', 'Mixing attribute and location queries', 'Reclassification and aggregation', 'Joining tables', 'Working with tables in ArcMap', 'Field calculations in tables'], ['Vector buffers', 'Vector intersection and union', 'Constraint analysis', 'Areal interpolation', 'Spatial join', 'ArcToolbox introduction', 'Raster zones and regions', 'Raster mask and NoData cells', 'Local raster operators', 'Focal raster operators', 'Zonal raster operators', 'Global raster operators', 'Raster weighted overlay', 'Mosaic and aggregate tools', 'What is geoprocessing?', 'ModelBuilder example', 'Getting started with ModelBuilder'], ['Design principles', 'Visual hierarchy', 'Contrast', 'Figure-ground relationship', 'Visual balance', 'Choropleth maps', 'Creating choropleth maps in ArcMap', 'Data classification for mapping', 'Data classification methods for mapping', 'Dot maps', 'Proportional symbol maps', 'Graduated symbol maps'], ['Guidelines for your story map']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 17 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

• Devise a content-based recommendation engine
• Implement a collaborative filtering recommendation engine
• Build a hybrid recommendation engine with user and content embeddings

This is a problem. There about 6 labs per course - in each of the 10 courses of the two Machine Learning specialisations. Each lab starts the same way - connect to the google cloud, allocate a vm, check out a git repository - exact same repository for all labs. It takes 10 minutes. Not 10 minutes where you can go away and have a cup of coffee - 10 minutes where you have to be there and accept terms, answer 'Y' etc. If the labs are done outside the Coursera context you would be able to pick up where you left off in the previous lab - zero setup time. But not here - it is too much wasted time: 10*6*10=600 minutes. Evil.", '确实教了东西，不过可用性很差，tutorial基本上对实践没什么帮助', 'No tensorflow.. lot of talk not a single math.. NOt good', "This was a large and hard course on ML and in particular for Recommendation Systems. The videos were way to long. The content was very interesting. I've learned new algorithms like WALS for Collaborative Filtering and others more.", 'very good course. Complex sometimes but well worth my time', "Excellent Course, in particular, the explanations around Google's Cloud Composer, the quality of the templates and the labs, thanks very much Lack and all your team for putting together this great specialization and course.", 'awesomw complexity. some videos are very long, but worth revisiting', 'Excelent End to end recomandation systems course', 'Great work by Google, a lot of material and system walk-throughs. Apache Airflow / Google Composer is a smart tool but perhaps too complicated where more simple e.g. bash cron scripts could suffice - however it is understood that for truly scalable end-to-end systems the traditional single-cloud-virtual-machine solutions will not do. We are shown how that could look like and much more.', 'Great contents!', 'An excellent course. Frankly to say, I did not fully understand the details of this specialization. But it let me get a general idea what Google is doing. GCP has a lot of cool staff, and definitely has a bright future. Thank you Googlers. ', 'it is very helpful to understand how recommendations system , GCP composer works.', 'I enjoyed this course too much, usually every company wants a recommended system, but the courses or examples available on the web are few. Very well explained many theoretical aspects.', 'Theoretical part was great and some of it was really new for me(eg. WALS, contextual recommendations).', 'A very challenging course.', 'I would like that in the course provide for more readings to keep it. ', 'Harder to follow than the other courses and did not love the teacher who led most of the lectures', "Bad course overall. It has some theoretical content in it, but concepts are not explained in depth and videos are sometimes hard to follow. Speaking of assignments, I had no motivation for completing them, because, firstly, they are not graded, and secondly, they are terribly designed and one won't get much from them.", 'Very poor course. Assignments are very weak and they do not test anything - there is no grader, you can just verify solution by watching the lab videos.', 'One star, but not to content. But because the course don\'t have "Audit" option. It\'s mean that after subscription ended and you received certificate, You can\'t more access to video material in course. When subscription active, You can use mobile application and download video material for studying offline. Before yours subscription ened, copy video material to safe place for later review.

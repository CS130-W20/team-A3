The first set of tools will explore data description, statistical inference, and regression. We will extend these concepts to other statistical methods used for prediction when the response variable is categorical such as win-don’t win an auction. In the next segment, students will learn about tools used for identifying important features in the dataset that can either reduce the complexity or help identify important features of the data or further help explain behavior. </course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Business.Leadership and Management</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Module 0:  Get Ready &amp; Module 1: Introduction to Analytics and Evolution of Statistical Inference//Module 2: Dating with Data//Module 3: Model Development and Testing with Holdout Data//Module 4: Curse of Dimensionality</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Data Modeling and Regression Analysis in Business', 'Rattle Installation Guidelines for Windows', 'Rattle Installation Guideline for MacOS', 'Rattle Interface for Windows', 'Lecture 1-1: Introduction to Analytics and Evolution of Statistical Inference', 'Lecture 1-2: From Data to Decisions', 'Lecture 1-3: The Evolution of Intelligent Machines', 'Lecture 1-4: Common Paradigms', 'Lecture 1-5-1: Examples of Paradigms – Part 1', 'Lecture 1-5-2: Examples of Paradigms – Part 2', 'Lecture 1-6: Introduction to Rattle', 'Lecture 1-7: Importing Datasets in Rattle', 'Lecture 1-8: Plotting Data and Creating Graphs in Rattle', 'Lecture 1-9: Rattle Practice and Summary'], ['Lecture 2-1: Explanatory Modeling Overview', 'Lecture 2-2: Developing and Estimating a Model', 'Lecture 2-3: Univariate and Bivariate Plots', 'Lecture 2-4: Bivariate Correlation', 'Lecture 2-5-1: Estimating With Simple Models - Part 1', 'Lecture 2-5-2: Estimating With Simple Models - Part 2', 'Lecture 2-6: Improving the Model', 'Lecture 2-7: Model Improvement Practice and Summary'], ['Lecture 3-1: Model Development Overview', 'Lecture 3-2: Introducing Root Mean Square Error', 'Lecture 3-3: Variable Selection', 'Lecture 3-4: Variable Selection with R Scripts', "Lecture 3-5: Introduction to Mallow's CP", 'Lecture 3-6-1: Modeling Example – Part 1', 'Lecture 3-6-2: Modeling Example – Part 2', 'Lecture 3-7: Example Wrap-Up and Summary'], ['Lecture 4-1: Data Types, Data Organization, and Data Modality', 'Lecture 4-2: Curse of Dimensionality', 'Lecture 4-3: Limitations of Scatterplots', 'Lecture 4-4: Principle Component Analysis', 'Lecture 4-5: Principle Component Analysis in Rattle', 'Lecture 4-6: Principle Component Analysis in Rattle With Regression', 'Lecture 4-7: Principle Component Analysis Exercise and Summary']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 19 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Excellent', 'Excellent course and great Teacher!', 'The course was easy to understand and fun to practice at home which made it exciting and useful at the same time. ', 'Very interesting course taught but a great professor.  Some material may benefit from additional background knowledge or further clarification, but overall good content and delivery.  This is not a beginner course and some understanding of elementary statistics is pretty much required.', 'this course is easier to understand the statistical modeling, no need to learn the deep algorithm', 'It would be better if the course is organized more in order based on teaching and homework pace.', 'This is a worst class you can take.

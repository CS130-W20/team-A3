Wiley, PhD</course_instructor><course_introduction>This course aims to teach the concepts of clinical data models and common data models. Upon completion of this course, learners will be able to interpret and evaluate data model designs using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), differentiate between data models and articulate how each are used to support clinical care and data science, and create SQL statements in Google BigQuery to query the MIMIC3 clinical data model and the OMOP common data model.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Colorado System</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction: Clinical Data Models and Common Data Models//Tools: Querying Clinical Data Models//Techniques: Extract-Transform-Load and Terminology Mapping//Techniques: Data Quality Assessments//Practical Application: Create an ETL Process to Transform a MIMIC-III Table to OMOP</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to Clinical Data Models and Data Quality Assessments', 'Clinical Research Data Warehouses', 'Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)', 'Clinical Data Models', 'Why Common Data Models?', 'A Quick Tour of a Common Data Model: i2b2', 'A Quick Tour of a Common Data Model: OMOP', 'A Quick Tour of a Common Data Model: Sentinel', 'A Quick Tour of a Common Data Model: PCORNet'], ['A Deep Dive into the MIMIC-III Data Model', 'Querying MIMIC-III', 'A Deep Dive into OMOP Data Model', 'Querying OMOP', 'Comparing the MIMIC and OMOP Data Models', 'The OHDSI Community Ecosystem'], ['The ETL Task', 'Structural versus Terminology Mapping', 'Data Profiling with White Rabbit', 'Data Mapping with the Rabbit in a Hat Tool', 'Terminology Mapping', 'Example mapping of MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person'], ['Data quality dimensions / fitness for use', 'Data profiling for data quality assessment', 'Data quality assessment using SQL', 'Callahan and Khare rules', 'OHDSI Achilles and Achilles Heel'], ['Review of the ETL process', 'Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Steps 1 and 2', 'Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Step3', 'Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Step 4', 'Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Steps 5 and 6', 'Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Step 7']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 21 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Gives a great understanding of ETL and the surrounding concepts from Zero. I personally found that a little boring, but for a total newbie to data and computers this is a perfect course.', 'Great course. ', 'Good instructor who took time to explain and walked  through each steps of the ETL process. Highly recommended.', 'Good course, but the video is a bit too long, split into shorter video course', "Teaching was excellent, but I feel that the peer reviewed feedback model for the final project may not be the most helpful since they're the only ones looking at your work (as opposed to an instructor). Additionally, there were quite a few typos in the quizzes", 'Material was presented fairly well for the most part. The lecture videos had some small editing errors which looked a bit unprofessional. The workload was also a bit unbalanced - there was very little structured hands-on training prior to the capstone project which can appear daunting at first.', 'Found very difficult to finish. ', "Contenu très intéressant dans l'ensemble, découverte des bases publiques et des concepts construits autour de ces éléments de la connaissance. Cette formation serait parfaite si la présentation était plus claire, en tout cas pour un français, moins répétitive et plus approfondie sur certains points. Les perspectives en connaissance partagée et connaissance induite (ML) seraient à explorer.

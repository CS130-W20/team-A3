We will become familiar with the major alpha, beta, and gamma diversity estimation techniques.

Understanding how biodiversity evolved and is evolving on Earth and how to correctly use and interpret biodiversity data is important for all students interested in conservation biology and ecology, whether they pursue careers in academia or as policy makers and other professionals (students graduating from our programs do both). Academics need to be able to use the theories and indices correctly, whereas policy makers must be able to understand and interpret the conclusions offered by the academics.

The course has the following expectations and results:

- covering the theoretical and practical issues involved in biodiversity theory,
- conducting surveys and inventories of biodiversity,
- analyzing the information gathered,
- and applying their analysis to ecological and conservation problems.

Needed Learner Background:

- basics of Ecology and Calculus
- good understanding of English</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Health.Basic Science</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>National Research Tomsk State University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Welcome to the course "Biological Diversity (Theories, Measures and Data sampling techniques)"//Biodiversity and evolution//Importance of biodiversity and anthropogenic impacts //Analyse and measure biodiversity//Species-abundance distributions and comparisons//Alternative measures of biodiversity//Statistics applied to the analysis of biodiversity </course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course promo', 'About the university'], ['1.1.

The steepness of the learning curve increased very quickly and understandability decreased after week 3, which made me drop the course. I hope to be able to retake it some time in the future with the right mathematical skills. ', 'Some of the suggested reading is behind paywalls. It would be helpful to have PDFs available to download through Coursera, rather than having to search for each title.', 'The course module is very simple and systematic', "Great course, the second half is all statistical equations, gives a good overview of seemingly every mathematical equation applicable to ecology.  I'd rather learn a few equations in depth than a rushed overview of the entire realm of statistics... but it was useful and I appreciate having a much greater sense of the subject, and it will be a great reference for me in the future.  ", "this course is pretty thorough as far as data sampling goes.  The professor is clearly very well versed in the statistical methods.  This course is mainly about statistical methods used in the field of biodiversity, so at the end, you will have to use the formulas mentioned in lectures (without any worked examples), so if you are not comfortable with calculus, it's not for you.  The transcripts are helpful but often incomprehensible.", 'wonderful course, terrific instructor. ', 'Es un curso bastante constructivo, ojalá exista otro como continuación de este.', 'This is a great course, very thorough and comprehensive introduction to Biological Diversity.', 'A well organized course from basics of biodiversity to the field requirements; it has covered the necessary methodologies. It was very useful. Special Thanks to Dr. Roberto Cazzolla Gatti of NRTS University; who was the backbone of the course.', None, 'Lots of new information. Really great course!', 'Great Course!!!', 'Love the course, thanks to all of you who made it possible', 'No pdf ', 'Very nice, quick overview. Formulation of equations in Biology leaves a bit to interpretation but this is a systemic issue. The guy is obviously highly proficient and comfortable with the subject matter never falters in his delivery. Assignments are all quizzes and the whole thing can be completed without undue pain.', 'At this point of time, when the climate change has gained pace and we are in a different world with erratic and unpredictable climate, it has become essential for us to set right the ecological balance, which is possible only by better understanding of biological diversity.', 'A very interesting and clearly presented course. I would recommend this course anyone who is interested in the study of biodiversity. ', 'Subs are not always understandable.', 'This course was very helpful but there is a need to discuss it more further in details.', 'All the statistical techniques must be moved to quizzes and problem-solving. Data sets can be given from actual field or lab data to work on. The lectures can focus on the conceptual nuances and the biological implications/assumptions/caveats of the statistics. That would be more helpful. ', 'The subjects are very interesting, but it is difficult to understand the professor. It was very frustrating that the quizzes weren´t graded unless you paid :/']</reviews><reviewers>['By John L', 'By Elizabeth S', 'By Shngainlang K', 'By Anthony C', 'By Anna M', 'By Marco A', 'By Anhorak S', 'By George C', 'By VINOTH K S', 'By Борисов Е В', 'By Marina D', 'By Untung S', 'By Rafael B S J', 'By Jeremiah H S S', 'By martin', 'By RAJA S T', 'By William M', 'By Diego B', 'By Sidra B', 'By Akhilesh J', 'By Camila G']</reviewers><review_date>['Sep 08, 2016', 'May 31, 2019', 'Mar 09, 2019', 'Oct 24, 2018', 'Mar 24, 2017', 'Dec 25, 2018', 'Aug 21, 2016', 'Oct 26, 2016', 'Jan 26, 2017', 'Feb 05, 2017', 'Jun 17, 2016', 'Sep 29, 2016', 'May 17, 2019', 'Nov 14, 2018', 'Aug 17, 2016', 'Jan 04, 2017', 'Jan 02, 2017', 'Jan 20, 2017', 'Dec 13, 2016', 'Feb 28, 2018', 'Aug 24, 2019']</review_date></doc>

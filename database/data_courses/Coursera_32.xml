Google thinks about machine learning slightly differently -- of being about logic, rather than just data. We talk about why such a framing is useful for data scientists when thinking about building a pipeline of machine learning models. 

Then, we discuss the five phases of converting a candidate use case to be driven by machine learning, and consider why it is important the phases not be skipped. We end with a recognition of the biases that machine learning can amplify and how to recognize this.

Many statements, especially towards the first videos, create an impression that the technology isn't superior enough to sell itself as we learn it, but requires a sales pitch even though we already subscribed to the specialization on that particular Machine Learning software.", 'This course lays the foundation of Machine Learning.', 'As an overview this course is OK. But the quality of labs can be improved. ', 'nice practical overview. I liked the first part with practical examples, the second part is too much marketing for Google APIs for me', 'Though the course provided has some good information for beginners, this is moreover like advertising google products.', 'The notebook based demos are unfortunately pretty useless as labs.

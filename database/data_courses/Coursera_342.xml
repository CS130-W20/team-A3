You will implement a complete application processing several gigabytes of data. This application will show interactive visualizations of the evolution of temperatures over time all over the world.

The development of such an application will involve:
 — transforming data provided by weather stations into meaningful information like, for instance, the average temperature of each point of the globe over the last ten years ;
 — then, making images from this information by using spatial and linear interpolation techniques ;
 — finally, implementing how the user interface will react to users’ actions.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Scala Programming//Parallel Computing//Apache Spark//Functional Programming</course_tag><course_rating>4.5</course_rating><course_orgnization>École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Project overview//Raw data display//Interactive visualization//Data manipulation//Value-added information visualization//Interactive user interface</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Project overview', 'Project setup'], ['Raw data visualization'], ['Milestone: interactive visualization in a Web app'], ['Data manipulation'], ['Value-added information visualization'], ['Interactive user interface']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 15 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['This is the hardest course of this Specialization, but I enjoyed it anyway. Thanks!', 'Thanks for designing the course.', 'Very fun and enjoyable project!', 'Thanks to the staff for any help, especially during a busy end of year', 'Most of the case, it is hard to deal with big data. This course provides an opportunity to handle big data and visualize the handled result on UI. Also, as you learned from FPD in Scala course, UI is developed with Scala.js', 'The perfect end of the course. It manages to recap all the concept, the libraries and the exercises that has been done during all other courses. It is a good point to remember all the things that one has been made, and a good point to review all the things that were not so clear.', 'Good course, some of the assignments could have been more explicit with expectations in cases where specific implementation details matter but the forums were helpful in that regard anyways.', 'Let\'s start with cons. Not often, but one have confusing exercise explanation(method docs contradict with assigment text), sometimes explanation is unclear in general. Too much geo math and in general course exercises look like "realize some formulae" definition. Grading tests output basically useless and it\'s sad. Tests must be the main point that explains proper way to right implementation and at some point being spec explanation.', 'week 2,3 very hard......', 'This capstone project  is a nice end of Scala specialisation! ', 'Thank you. The course is really nice.', 'Very challenging. Great course/project/specialization', 'Nice course which cement your knowledge of scala in action!', 'This entire Scala series has been excellent. ', 'Phenominal course! Well organized, good pace, great combination of "practical theory" with examples that illustrate the concepts. and very clear well-thought out explanations by Dr. Miller. Best Spark class I\'ve seen, and best class in this series (sorry, Dr. Odersky).', 'Thank you! Learned a lot!', 'Awesome project!. It is not only wrapping all the previous concepts in a real use case, but also introducing  a lot of different algorithms! Calculate deviations, spatial interpolation,  great-circle distance, inverse distance weighting, etc.', 'Great course, I learned a lot. Thank you!', 'An excellent well paced climax to the Functional Programming specialism', 'Im not finished yet, but its really nice one. Much place to play with data and optimization beyond actual course requirements. Lot of freedom in implementation wich is great. Ive already learned a lot and planning to spend time playnig with Observatory project further just for fun and experience. Thank you so much for this opportunity! :)', 'Thanks', 'Kind of a long homework, quite open-ended in the sense that implementations are not guided step by step by the instructor. Some of the tasks can be approached in different ways and can be quite challenging at time.', 'Well structured. Interesting subject.', 'Learn a lot about functional programming and spark, it inspires me how the data could be process in big data world.', 'Great course and specialization! Many thanks!']</reviews><reviewers>['By Denys L', 'By Subodh C', 'By John S', 'By Jonathan W', 'By Gyeongmin G', 'By Massimiliano D', 'By Kevin B', 'By Артем К', 'By 재문 심', 'By Pavel O', 'By Andrew O', 'By Vital A', 'By CAI X', 'By John V M', 'By Douglas N', 'By Andrew K', 'By Diego D W M', 'By Jon Z', 'By Stephen P', 'By Alexandr T', 'By IURII B ', 'By Roberto S', 'By Eric L', 'By CHUI C H', 'By Mykola S']</reviewers><review_date>['Jan 03, 2019', 'Mar 28, 2019', 'Mar 12, 2019', 'Mar 05, 2019', 'Aug 28, 2018', 'Nov 19, 2018', 'Jun 14, 2017', 'Nov 06, 2017', 'Jun 04, 2017', 'May 13, 2017', 'Apr 19, 2017', 'May 17, 2017', 'Jul 31, 2017', 'Jun 26, 2017', 'Apr 30, 2017', 'Apr 06, 2017', 'May 07, 2018', 'Jul 05, 2017', 'May 25, 2017', 'Apr 30, 2017', 'Aug 07, 2017', 'Jul 18, 2017', 'Jun 02, 2017', 'Aug 15, 2017', 'Sep 29, 2017']</review_date></doc>

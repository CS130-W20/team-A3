By the end of this course, you should be able to implement a working recommender system (e.g. to predict ratings, or generate lists of related products), and you should understand the tools and techniques required to deploy such a working system on real-world, large-scale datasets.

This course is the final course in the Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics Specialization, building on the previous three courses (Basic Data Processing and Visualization, Design Thinking and Predictive Analytics for Data Products, and Meaningful Predictive Modeling). At each step in the specialization, you will gain hands-on experience in data manipulation and building your skills, eventually culminating in a capstone project encompassing all the concepts taught in the specialization.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Python Programming//Big Data Products//Recommender Systems</course_tag><course_rating>4.2</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of California San Diego</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction//Implementing Recommender Systems//Deploying Recommender Systems//Project 4: Recommender System//Capstone</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to Recommender Systems', 'Recommender Systems versus Other Forms of Supervised Learning', 'Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation', 'Latent Factor Models (Part 1)', 'Latent Factor Models (Part 2)'], ['Implementing a Similarity-Based Recommender', 'Similarity-Based Recommender for Rating Prediction', 'Implementing a Latent Factor Model (Part 1)', 'Implementing a Latent Factor Model (Part 2)'], ['Intro to Web Server Frameworks (in Python)', 'Intro to Django', 'Flask'], ['Project Description', 'How to Find a Dataset'], ['Description of Capstone Tasks']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>English</course_time><reviews>[]</reviews><reviewers>[]</reviewers><review_date>[]</review_date></doc>

From the absence of recent discussion posts it seems that this is not really a current, viable course.   From what I have seen of the course, I get the impression that even if package installation went smoothly, the course is more about R than statistics or genomics - which is not what I joined for.', 'Very good course and useful understanding statistical aspects of data.', '\n\nExcellent, but I would be grateful if you could translate all your courses of absolute quality into Spanish.  ', 'really a good course for people who want to learn use R to dispose genomic data', 'The professor is really enthusiasm, so I was really impreesed by him. And his teaching is brief, and I can learn key points through the lectures. Great course!', 'Excellent course! Thank you!', 'Really great and in-depth class! thank you', 'talk fast and informative!

I found it the most helpful in building together what should be learned in genomic data science.  I wish 1) this course was earlier in the specialization, 2) there was additional building from this course to build together the workflow from beginning to end, and 3) reduction or removal of some of the other courses (or other courses taught together with this one).', "It is really great that told me lots of basic statistical information that I didn't know.

Not without its flaws (inconsistent video audio levels), but I have walked away knowing far more about Genomic Data Science than I expected to.', 'Enjoyed it. One of better courses I have taken in Coursera. A good introduction to using statistics in Bioconductor with genomics data. ', 'Nice course.

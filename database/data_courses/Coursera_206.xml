Consequently, they are bound to hire more and more spatial data scientists.  Based on such business trend, this course is designed to present a firm understanding of spatial data science to the learners, who would have a basic knowledge of data science and data analysis, and eventually to make their expertise differentiated from other nominal data scientists and data analysts.  Additionally, this course could make learners realize the value of spatial big data and the power of open source software's to deal with spatial data science problems.

This course will start with defining spatial data science and answering why spatial is special from three different perspectives - business, technology, and data in the first week.  In the second week, four disciplines related to spatial data science - GIS, DBMS, Data Analytics, and Big Data Systems, and the related open source software's - QGIS, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, R, and Hadoop tools are introduced together.  During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks, you will learn the four disciplines one by one from the principle to applications.  In the final week, five real world problems and the corresponding solutions are presented with step-by-step procedures in environment of open source software's.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Spatial Analysis//Qgis//Big Data//Geographic Information System (GIS)</course_tag><course_rating>4.4</course_rating><course_orgnization>Yonsei University</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Understanding Spatial Data Science//Solution Structures of Spatial Data Science Problems//Geographic Information System (GIS)//Spatial DBMS and Big Data Systems//Spatial Data Analytics //Practical Applications of Spatial Data Science</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to the course', '1.1 Introduction to Spatial Data Science', '1.2 Why is Spatial Special?

It is very compact and exhaustive. Mostly theorethical.', 'Very boring and no hands on content.', 'very nice and easy to understanding lesson.', 'This course was very comprehensive, explanatory and introduced me to some complex applications of spatial data science.', 'Nice course! But need more practice, something like project-oriented course/', "Good course that gives quality review on what spatial data science is and what can you do with it. It doesn't teach you how to use programs, rather gives you instructions what programs you should learn and powers of each program.", 'Muy buen curso. Muy completo. Lo recomiendo mucho.', 'Great course. It helps I\nhave a background in\nboth Data Science and Geographic Information Science, but still found\nit equally interesting and challenging! I would highly recommend\nthis course.', 'An excellent course, it was an introduction to spatial data science and all techniques that we might apply for different solutions. This course gave us a valuable idea of spatial data science and the importance of the 4 main disciplines of this exciting field. Thanks a lot!', 'Course is amazing.', '\nVery good course, especially regarding spatial database, because my knowledge was limited only to a spatial analysis.\n\n', '.', 'Thanks for your wonderful lecture! :)', 'Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood', 'This was an excellent course. I honestly thought I had pretty good handle on this topic, but I learned a lot of new concepts and applications and deepened my existing knowledge base. Furthermore, I really enjoyed the real world examples in the last section. In particular, the military infiltration example was very interesting. Thank you!', 'The most comprehensive introductory cause in Geo-spatial Data science . I love it.', 'Unbelievable course for Spatial data science', 'Excelent!! It could be an specialization of Spatial Data Science!!', 'Awesome ', '  Great course. Thanks Prof Joon Heo.   ', 'very insightful and impacting session laced with applicable examples and contemporary issues. Thank you coursera. Thank you Yonsei University.', 'Practical, updated and well explained', 'The class struck a great balance between technology, science and business, which really helped me find my way through GIS. I need to praise the teacher for the structure of the class and for his diagrams: the clearly conveyed a conveyed the his experience and mastery of the topic.', 'Very informative course indeed. Thank you', 'Great value for the beginner like me!']</reviews><reviewers>['By CHESSEL P', 'By Rustom S S', 'By Mumtaz A', 'By Rodrigo V', 'By Sergiy S', 'By Aleksandar M', 'By Camilo A P', 'By Michael B W', 'By Johans A A', 'By Rajeev K', 'By Rolando N F V', 'By sushmita g', 'By Yeosan Y', 'By Sungha J', 'By Daniel L', 'By Bernard D W J', 'By Sangyoon P', 'By Alejandro R', 'By Priyanka C', 'By Akella V A K', 'By Imoh E', 'By Alicia A G d m', 'By Rudy M P', 'By Muhammad U', 'By Jani P']</reviewers><review_date>['Jul 16, 2019', 'Apr 08, 2018', 'Feb 05, 2019', 'Nov 24, 2018', 'Jan 19, 2019', 'Feb 10, 2019', 'Dec 02, 2018', 'Aug 14, 2018', 'Oct 12, 2018', 'Sep 26, 2018', 'Oct 03, 2018', 'Oct 04, 2018', 'Mar 14, 2018', 'May 11, 2018', 'Apr 04, 2018', 'Feb 15, 2018', 'Mar 19, 2018', 'Jul 02, 2018', 'Oct 24, 2018', 'Mar 26, 2019', 'Jul 05, 2019', 'Jul 15, 2019', 'Aug 05, 2019', 'Jun 12, 2019', 'Aug 19, 2019']</review_date></doc>

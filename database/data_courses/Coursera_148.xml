You will balance the goals of your stakeholders with the needs of your end-users, and be able to structure and organize your story for maximum impact. Throughout the course you will apply more advanced functions within Tableau, such as hierarchies, actions and parameters to guide user interactions.  For your final project, you will create a compelling narrative to be delivered in a meeting, as a static report, or in an interactive display online.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Storyboarding//Tableau Software//Data Virtualization//Data Visualization (DataViz)</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of California, Davis</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Planning and Preproduction: Aligning your Audience, Stakeholders, and Data//Key Metrics, Indicators, and Decision Triggers//Dashboard and Storytelling with Data//Tell the Story of Your Data</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Introduction', 'What is a Story?', 'Introduction to Planning and Preproduction for Visualizations', 'A Design Checklist of the Who, What, Why, and How', 'Start with Your Stakeholders', 'Addressing Your Audience and Their Context', 'Finding the Story', 'Prioritizing, Optimizing, and Designing the Data Story', 'Case Study - "The Tale of 100 Entrepreneurs" (Part 1)', 'Case Study - "The Tale of 100 Entrepreneurs" (Part 2)', 'Case Study - "The Tale of 100 Entrepreneurs" (Part 3)'], ['Introduction to Key Metrics, Indicators, and Decision Triggers', 'Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)', 'Tableau Calculated Fields and KPIs', 'Creating Complex KPIs Using Tableau', 'Thresholds and Alerts', 'Data Quality'], ['Best Practices for Dashboard Design', 'Dashboard Design Principles 1, 2, &amp; 3', 'Dashboard Design Principles 4, 5, &amp; 6', 'Hierarchies, Actions, Filters, and Parameters (Parts 1&amp;2)', 'Hierarchies, Actions, Filters, and Parameters (Part 3)', 'Hierarchies, Actions, Filters, and Parameters (Part 4)', 'Important Considerations for Creating Dashboards'], ['Tell the Story of Your Data Introduction', 'The Art of Storytelling (Past, Present, and Future)', 'Storytelling and the Human Brain', 'Bringing Data to Life: Emotions and Data Storytelling', 'Emotion Modulators: Color, Language, and Other Design Elements', 'Framing and Format', 'Framing, Conventions, and Priming', 'False Narratives and Data Storytelling', 'Telling the Stories within the Story (Part 1)', 'Telling the Stories within the Story (Part 2)', 'Story Considerations', 'Preparation of the Story Points', 'Setting Up the Story', 'Creating Points in the Story', 'Interactive Story', 'Create a Data Story in a Static Presentation', 'Course Summary']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 19 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>["Week 1 starts off where Course 1 &amp; 2 left off... more lectures without course-directed opportunity to apply the lessons.

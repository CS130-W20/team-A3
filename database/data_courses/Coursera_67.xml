I learned a lot about what-if analyses and error checking that will be very helpful.  The instruction on macros could be more detailed to include how to use macros with lists in data validation and how to edit.', 'Extremely useful for Accounting graduates. ', 'Course is fantastic, but the quizzes and challenges many times bring examples that have not been explained thoroughly. on the videos, it is given a simple example and then when it goes to quizzes and challenges, it brings a question that is way out of the depth of what has been explained.', '  Great course, the way they teach is easy to digest and very well structured. A++++  ', '  A rewarding experience because I have been able to learn very valuable information. It is an excellent course. It has helped me in the personal and professional field. Thank you.  ', 'Hard course for sure, but It worth all the efforts', 'This course gives us a deep insight to many beautiful tools and features about excel which we never usually see. It greatly has increased my efficiency &amp; makes me feel more professional!', 'A bit harder than Intermediate I, but still achievable. Thanks. ', 'A brilliantly designed course. Teaches you a lot and keeps you engaged.', 'A course rich in great content.', "Really helped me in clearing basics of Macro. Need to learn more about Macro's", 'very helpful course.', 'Very Very excelllent Course as its previous courses.', 'Absolutely brilliant. ', 'Learn this course material to validate and automate excel work.', 'Not an overly difficult course but sufficiently challenging to improve my Excel skills.  Excellent instructors for the course.', 'Everything is broken down into reasonable chunks so that you are not overwhelmed. Instructors also provide excellent examples to walk through each concept.', 'Great course. You learn things that you do not know that exists but are so useful when you know them, it is great course 100% recommended.', 'It was awesome experience', 'Really insightful!! Thank you Coursera and Macquarie Uni', 'Best way to learn ecxel', 'Excellent quality. Builds on the skills learned in Essentials and Intermediate I and follows the same format. There is a jump in difficulty from Intermediate I, but the content of the class makes it manageable. I learned quite a bit in this course despite thinking of myself as a high-intermediate to low-advanced Excel user prior to taking this specialization. I highly recommend to anyone who took the prior two courses.', 'After taking Intermediate 1, I felt really confident that I could do a good Excel, but after Intermediate 2, now I felt sure of any task or Excel workbok I was passed, I could take it, improve it and automatize it for better efficiency.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Guido N', 'By Oleksandr L', 'By Casey N', 'By Lee C C', 'By Gisele', 'By Hayley B', 'By Carlos J B A', 'By Basel A Q', 'By Rushabh D D', 'By Xu C', 'By Sajag M', 'By Sushant K', 'By Muhammad F K', 'By LALIT K A', 'By Ayesha F', 'By Nathan H', 'By Ashish C', 'By Bernie K', 'By Jason Y', 'By Marlon A Z Z', 'By Harris A', 'By Utsav P', 'By Irma A H A', 'By Paul J B', 'By Sebastian T R']</reviewers><review_date>['May 23, 2019', 'May 14, 2019', 'Feb 22, 2019', 'Apr 09, 2019', 'May 16, 2019', 'Jan 24, 2019', 'Apr 24, 2019', 'Dec 15, 2018', 'Nov 27, 2018', 'Dec 01, 2018', 'Dec 18, 2018', 'Dec 03, 2018', 'Dec 04, 2018', 'Dec 26, 2018', 'Dec 28, 2018', 'Dec 29, 2018', 'Jan 12, 2019', 'Dec 30, 2018', 'Jan 01, 2019', 'Jan 01, 2019', 'Jan 03, 2019', 'Feb 18, 2019', 'Feb 17, 2019', 'Feb 06, 2019', 'Jan 25, 2019']</review_date></doc>

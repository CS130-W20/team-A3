• Predict future values of a time-series
• Classify free form text
• Address time-series and text problems with recurrent neural networks
• Choose between RNNs/LSTMs and simpler models
• Train and reuse word embeddings in text problems

You will get hands-on practice building and optimizing your own text classification and sequence models on a variety of public datasets in the labs we’ll work on together.

Could be more on DL itself. ', 'This was a very interesting course on NLP and Time Series. My only concern is that some notebooks worked for python 2 mode and not for python 3. Also, the tensor 2 tensor lab could not be completed in 2 hours, as some of the training may take more than 3 hours to complete.', 'Videos were too short. Explanations of the key concepts were really poor. Quiz in week 1 had error that was raised by the user 6 months ago and it is still not fixed. Coding section had library mismatch that led to errors. The presentation of the materials were good. ', 'No Doubt COURSERA is always best AND MNC like IBM,Google courses associated with coursera are MIND-BLOWING. ', 'Excellent course for those who know RNN. Knowledge is refreshed and techniques are consolidated. More details about Google ecosystem is introduced. ', "Subscribing to this course only gives you option to run assignments on Qwik labs, and they're very poor for these kinds of assignments. You won't get any feedback on assignments anyway since there is no grader.", 'One star, but not to content. But because the course don\'t have "Audit" option. It\'s mean that after subscription ended and you received certificate, You can\'t more access to video material in course. When subscription active, You can use mobile application and download video material for studying offline. Before yours subscription ended, copy video material to safe place for later review. ', 'I really loved it!', 'Good', 'Great one!', 'Very good.The explanation of the RNN was very good but the tensor2tensor was very hard. ', 'Excellent Sequence Models explanations and examples to learn from, I quite enjoyed all the fantastic tips and best practices recommended by Google, looking forward to the next course in the specialization.', 'Quite a challenging course so far.', 'this course is helpful for learning sequence data with tensor flow ,Thanks for this course', 'pretty great', 'Great way to practically learn a lot of stuff. Sometimes, a lot of it starts to go over head. But, it is completely worth the learning curve! Definitely recommend it!', "Lot's of good information. I cannot wait to start using this knowledge. Thank you!", 'I like it because it is very relevant to my work. The dialogflow part is a bit weak. I am not sure if it is the product or the course. ', None, 'Very informative, very much useful to my ongoing work on NLP.', 'Very helpful but needs more in depth detail how attention works, how encoder/decoder trains and makes predictions ', "Though not focused on fundamental concepts, it's a great course to learn to use tensorflow and google cloud platform for sequence modelling.", 'Complex but interesting', 'The content is amazing and some of the implementations are really awesome! I am not a programmer but this course opened me the eyes to see how many business opportunities are there to use data for AI, in new products and services']</reviews><reviewers>['By vincent p', 'By Yunwei H', 'By Harold L M M', 'By Temuge B', 'By Arindam G', 'By Jun W', 'By Jakub B', 'By Maxim', 'By Elias P', 'By Raja R G', 'By ELINGUI P U', 'By Mark D', 'By Carlos V', 'By Jason C', 'By 林佳佑', 'By Nguyễn V L', 'By Putcha L N R', 'By Armando F', 'By Ayman S', 'By Печатнов Ю', 'By Hemant D K', 'By Marios N', 'By Harsh S', 'By borja v ', 'By Silviu M']</reviewers><review_date>['Feb 24, 2019', 'Feb 20, 2019', 'Nov 25, 2018', 'Apr 26, 2019', 'Dec 20, 2018', 'Nov 11, 2018', 'Jun 26, 2019', 'Jul 05, 2019', 'Dec 04, 2018', 'Dec 11, 2018', 'Jan 27, 2019', 'Feb 03, 2019', 'Feb 03, 2019', 'Oct 19, 2018', 'Nov 02, 2018', 'Apr 14, 2019', 'Aug 11, 2019', 'Jun 01, 2019', 'Aug 17, 2019', 'Nov 22, 2018', 'Dec 01, 2018', 'Jun 10, 2019', 'Jul 23, 2019', 'Jul 22, 2019', 'Aug 28, 2019']</review_date></doc>

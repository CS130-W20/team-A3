The first section focuses on the basic building blocks of GIS data, so that you know what types of GIS files exist, and the implications of choosing one type over another. Next, we'll discuss metadata (which is information about a data set) so you know how to evaluate a data set before you decide to use it, as well as preparing data by merging and clipping files as needed. We'll then talk about how to take non-GIS data, such as a list of addresses, and convert it into "mappable" data using geocoding. Finally, you'll learn about how to take data that you have found and design a map using cartographic principles. In the course project, you will find your own data and create your own quantitative map.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Physical Science and Engineering.Environmental Science and Sustainability</course_category><course_tag>Geographic Information System (GIS)//Cartography//Esri//Mapping//Spatial Analysis</course_tag><course_rating>4.8</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Toronto</course_orgnization><course_chapter>GIS File Types, Data Models, and Topology//Finding data and preparing it for your project//Geocoding addresses and postal codes//Map Design Principles//Mapping Quantitative Data//Quantitative Map Types//Project: Getting Data and Making Your Own Map</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Welcome to the course!', 'Introduction to topology', 'Topology and data formats', 'Shapefile: simple, with no topology', 'Coverage: Complex, but has topology', 'Comparison of shapefile, coverage, and geodatabase', 'Building basic topology', 'Georelational and object-relational vector data models'], ['Evaluating data using metadata', 'Data dictionary', 'The importance of metadata', 'Viewing and editing metadata in ArcMap', 'Downloading and using GIS data', 'Adding x,y data from a table', 'Clipping a feature class', 'Merging feature classes'], ['What is geocoding?', 'Geocoding in ArcGIS Online', 'Geocoding postal codes', 'Geocoding postal codes in ArcMap', 'Postal codes and census data', 'Canadian census units', 'Ecological fallacy', 'Geocoding street addresses', 'Geocoding street addresses in ArcMap'], ['Developing a critical eye', 'The map design process', 'Controls on map design, part 1', 'Controls on map design, part 2', 'Controls on map design, part 3', 'Design principles', 'Visual hierarchy', 'Figure-ground relationship', 'Contrast', 'Legibility', 'Visual balance', 'Map elements', 'Creating a map layout in ArcMap', 'Basic map design in ArcMap', 'Exporting a map as an image in ArcMap', 'Typography', 'Creating and customizing labels in ArcMap'], ['Levels of measurement and mapping', 'Colour models: RGB', 'Colour models: HSV', 'Colour models: CMYK', 'Choropleth maps', 'Creating choropleth maps in ArcMap', 'Data classification for mapping', 'Data classification methods for mapping', 'Mean vs. median', 'Zero values on your map', 'Joining tables', 'Working with tables in ArcMap', 'Field calculations in tables'], ['Dot maps', 'Creating dot density maps in ArcMap', 'Proportional symbol maps', 'Graduated symbol maps', 'Creating proportional and graduated symbol maps in ArcMap', 'Contour maps', 'Flow maps', 'Multivariate maps'], ['$null$']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 19 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['I love this program ', "I learned a lot about spatial analysis.

While this is placing emphasis on the input of quality health data in digital records and systems, the delivery of safe and quality healthcare relies not only on the input of data, but also the ability to access and derive meaning from data to generate evidence, inform decision making and drive better health outcomes.

This course provides insight into the use of healthcare data, including an overview of best practices and the practical realities of obtaining useful information from digital health systems via the understanding of the fundamental concepts of health data analytics.  

Learners will understand why data quality is essential in modern healthcare, as they are guided through various stages of the data life cycle, starting with the generation of quality health data, through to discovering patterns and extracting knowledge from health data using common methodologies and tools in the basic analysis, visualisation and communication of health data. In doing so, learners explore current healthcare delivery contexts, and future and emerging digital health data systems and applications that are rapidly becoming tomorrow’s reality.

On completion of this course, you will be able to:
1.	Identify digital health technologies, health data sources, and the evolving roles of health workforce in digital health environments
2.	Understand key health data concepts and terminology, including the significance of data integrity and stakeholder roles in the data life cycle
3.	Use health data and basic data analysis to inform and improve decision making and practice.
4.	Apply effective methods of communication of health data to facilitate safe and quality care.

Very nice illustration on terminologies used for data retrieval and data analytics a must-attend course for all those professionals who are keen to make an impact on patient-centred care.  I am glad that I did this course at the right time when our hospitals are changing into electronic medical records. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding data errors and how it affects patient management. The clear message from this course is every individual working in hospital settings has a role to play in the data integrity. Highly recommended course. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

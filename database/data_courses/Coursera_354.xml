You will have a working understanding of the digital thread – the stream that starts at product concept and continues to accumulate information and data throughout the product’s life cycle – and identify opportunities to leverage it. 

Gain an understanding of how "the right information, in the right place, at the right time" should flow. This is one of the keys to unlocking the potential of a digital design process. Acknowledging this will enable you to be more involved in a product’s development cycle, and to help a company become more flexible. 

Main concepts of this course will be delivered through lectures, readings, discussions and various videos. 

This is the second course in the Digital Manufacturing &amp; Design Technology specialization that explores the many facets of manufacturing’s “Fourth Revolution,”  aka Industry 4.0, and features a culminating project involving creation of a roadmap to achieve a self-established DMD-related professional goal.

Thanks to Ken.', 'Excellent!', 'Let me start with thanking the faculty and Coursera for breaking down the course in a structured manner. The course was good as a starter pack for anyone who is new to the field and has little or no information technology background. For existing practitioners much of the content would be known, specially topics for Week 2. ', 'To understand thoroughly how Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing the means of production, we must understand the components of this revolution. This course explains a number of them.', 'Very helpful to understand the vital nature of information in product life cycle. ', 'Nice Course.!!', 'This program is a must for every mechanical engineer and industrial engineer involved in product development and manufacturing in general.', None, 'Sparking illusions about projects to be set up. ', 'The concepts in this class are also applicable in many other fields and practices. Basically, the course emphasizes the importance of digitizing and quantifying our data and models so that we can make well informed decisions with much better precision than randomly guessing.', 'It was an awesome experience with ken English sir ', None, 'Amazing ', 'The course gives a good overview about the digital thread components and supports learning with real life examples', 'excellent course and instructed very good !!', None, 'This course gives indepth focus to learn about components of digital thread', "The link of Youtbue video of Predix Architecture doesn't work.  ", "Good overall introduction to the digital thread and it's various components", "This course is all about showing what components are involved in seeing an integrated view of everything about an asset or product throughout its life cycle -- the Digital Thread.  You can see the 30,000ft view or look at the nitty-gritty details using the resources the course provides.  It's all up to you.

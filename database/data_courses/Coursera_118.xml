This course will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis - types of variables, common distributions, hypothesis testing - but, more than that, it will enable you to take a data set you've never seen before, describe its keys features, get to know its strengths and quirks, run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions. You'll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series. You'll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software R, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere. It's hands-on, so you'll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media. Then you'll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits: data that are realistically messy, because that's what public health data sets are like in reality. There will be mini-quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding. The course will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted: in this age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news, these skills are more important than ever.

Prerequisites

Some formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it. You will need only basic numeracy (for example, we will not use calculus) and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results. No knowledge of R or programming is assumed.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Health.Public Health</course_category><course_tag>Run basic analyses in R//R Programming//Understand common data distributions and types of variables//Formulate a scientific hypothesis</course_tag><course_rating>4.7</course_rating><course_orgnization>Imperial College London</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Introduction to Statistics in Public Health//Types of Variables, Common Distributions and Sampling//Introduction to R and RStudio//Hypothesis Testing in R</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Introduction to Statistical Thinking for Public Health', 'Uses of Statistics in Public Health', 'Introduction to Sampling', 'How to Formulate a Research Question', "Formulating a research question for the Parkinson's disease and supplement studies"], ['Introduction to variables, distribution and sampling', 'Overview of types of variables', 'Well-behaved Distributions', 'Real-world Distributions and their Problems', 'The Role of Sampling in Public Health Research', 'How to choose a Sample'], ['How to describe distributions of real data', 'How to Load Data and run Basic Tabulations in R'], ['Sampling errors for proportions and central limit theorem', 'Hypothesis Testing', 'Choosing the Sample Size for your Study', 'Summary of Course']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 11 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Learned a lot! The structure of the course was very logical and manageable. Will be continuing with the rest of the courses in the Specialization.', 'This was a great introduction. to statistics in public health.  Thanks!', 'I found this data very interesting and useful learnt very new sets of skills and will carry on in this topic.', 'The course gives an introduction to basic statistics commonly used in medicine/public health. The key concepts are explained clearly and provide a good foundation. However, there are few lectures (mostly reading material) and many tests are "check yourself" ones. The course would benefit if current reading material was given in lectures (as it is mostly words) and the more advanced reading material was included with more formal/mathematical description of the concepts.', 'very friendly for new beginners', 'I highly recommend it', 'Superb course. I will recommend to all Public Health Practitioners.', 'Wonderful explanation and introduction to R programing. With minimal additional self learning you can easily master all of the content of the course.', 'Clear and no nonsense.  Do recommend.', 'I will definitely recommend anyone to undergo the materials provided from Imperial faculty to hone statistical reasoning skill and enhance problem solving capacity. Indeed a organized and effective course after a bit long time.', 'I very much enjoyed the course!', 'Excellent introduction to statistics and R', 'I love the simplicity of the explanations', 'Awesome course and the teaching was superb', 'Was a very nicely done and clear course to build or re-build foundation for most common statistical concepts and an intro to using R via R-Studio for your work with them on the basics.', 'I learned a lot about statistical analysis through this course', 'Excelente!', 'Great presentation and relevant materials for studying', 'An absolutely fantastic course. Compared with my course back at Uni, this is 100 times clearer.', 'excellent course for beginners', 'Outstanding', 'Excellent course if you want to start using R for public health projects! 100% recommended!', 'Really explanatory.. assignments, discussion prompts made me think and clarified important concepts.', 'a very good class', 'Very helpful, and interesting lecturer !']</reviews><reviewers>['By Indhu R', 'By Dean P', 'By Shubham J S', 'By Georgy M', 'By Yifan Z', 'By Enrique D O', 'By Usman A', 'By Mayur N', 'By Thomas J H', 'By Rashidul H', 'By Rahim H', 'By salome a', 'By Anderson S', 'By Oriolowo T A', 'By Liva A', 'By harshal D', 'By Eddy A S M', 'By Muhire I', 'By Katerina K', 'By  R D', 'By ONUOHA C A', 'By Tommys J G G', 'By Jeba M', 'By Nimmi P', 'By Rizky M B']</reviewers><review_date>['May 16, 2019', 'Jul 08, 2019', 'Jun 26, 2019', 'Jun 08, 2019', 'Mar 27, 2019', 'Mar 31, 2019', 'Apr 07, 2019', 'Apr 08, 2019', 'Mar 31, 2019', 'May 05, 2019', 'May 06, 2019', 'May 10, 2019', 'Apr 27, 2019', 'Jun 14, 2019', 'May 26, 2019', 'May 30, 2019', 'Jun 03, 2019', 'May 23, 2019', 'Jun 08, 2019', 'Jun 19, 2019', 'Jun 24, 2019', 'Jul 06, 2019', 'Jul 19, 2019', 'Jul 22, 2019', 'Aug 01, 2019']</review_date></doc>

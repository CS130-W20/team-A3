In this course, you'll use analytical elements of SQL for answering business intelligence questions. You'll learn features of relational database management systems for managing summary data commonly used in business intelligence reporting. Because of the importance and difficulty of managing implementations of data warehouses, we'll also delve into storage architectures, scalable parallel processing, data governance, and big data impacts.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>Data Warehousing//Materialized View//Data Warehouse//SQL</course_tag><course_rating>4.6</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Colorado System</course_orgnization><course_chapter>DBMS Extensions and Example Data Warehouses//SQL Subtotal Operators//SQL Analytic Functions//Materialized View Processing and Design//Physical Design and Governance</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course introduction video', 'Course objectives video lecture', 'Course topics and assignments video lecture', 'DBMS extensions video lecture', 'Relational database schema patterns video lecture', 'Colorado Education Data Warehouse video lecture', 'Data warehouse standards in health care video lecture'], ['GROUP BY clause review video lecture', 'SQL CUBE operator video lecture', 'SQL ROLLUP operator video lecture', 'SQL GROUPING SETS operator video lecture', 'Variations of subtotal operators video lecture'], ['Processing Model and Basic Syntax video lecture', 'Extended Syntax and Ranking Functions video lecture', 'Window Comparison I video lecture', 'Window Comparisons II video lecture', 'Functions for Ratio Comparisons video lecture'], ['Background on traditional views video lecture', 'Materialized view definition and processing video lecture', 'Query Rewriting Rules video lecture', 'Query Rewriting Examples video lecture', 'Oracle Tools for Data Integration video lecture'], ['Storage Architectures video lecture', 'Scalable Parallel Processing Approaches video lecture', 'Big data issues video lecture', 'Data Governance video lecture', 'Closing Lecture']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 16 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['Great course to learn the BI concepts', 'The instructor provide the materials well ', 'EXCELLENT COURSE', 'Nice Course', 'great¡¡', 'nice course very useful', 'It was amazing, I am satisfied with all the knowledges I had acquired.

Software capabilities will be covered with R® receiving particular emphasis.  The course will also cover the basics of record linkage and statistical matching—both of which are becoming more important as ways of combining data from different sources.  Combining of datasets raises ethical issues which the course reviews.  Informed consent may have to be obtained from persons to allow their data to be linked. You will learn about differences in the legal requirements in different countries.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag /><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of Maryland, College Park</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Basic Estimation//Models//Record Linkage//Ethics</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Overview', 'Basic R examples', 'Basic R examples (continued)', 'Degrees of Freedom', 'Estimating Means', 'Multistage samples', 'Quantile estimation in R'], ['Introduction', 'Estimation Method', 'Linear Models', 'Diagnostics in R', 'Linear Models in Stata', 'Logistic Models in R', 'Odds Ratios', 'Logistic Regression in Stata'], ['Why we link records', 'Gentle Introduction', 'Challenges', 'Key Techniques'], ['Privacy and Confidentiality', 'Linkage Consent and Consent Bias', 'Correlates of Consent', 'Bias in Administrative Estimates', 'Optimizing Linkage Consent']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 7 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['I liked the practical examples', 'My name is Jose Antonio.

Also I think that the quizzes are not necesarily correlated with the presentation or talks. This is challenging, and usually is good, but there are no enough guides or Reading material to conpensate the lack of clarity and the extra concepts needed to know.

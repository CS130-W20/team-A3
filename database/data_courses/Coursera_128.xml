Here we will cover how to ingest new external datasets into BigQuery and  visualize them with Google Data Studio. We will also cover intermediate SQL concepts like multi-table JOINs and UNIONs which will allow you to analyze data across multiple data sources.

Note: Even if you have a background in SQL, there are BigQuery specifics (like handling query cache and table wildcards) that may be new to you.

', 'Nice course, quick and objective!', 'Amazing teacher and materials', 'Great course, amazing instructor.', 'Eventually I will get to the ML portion of this Specialization and then the gloves come off.  I have some problems i need solved and some ML algorithms to make.  My tiny brain can not ingest  any more data feeds. I need Biquery and ML to do it for me :)', 'The learning material is very detailed.', 'Muy buen curso', 'great course by google', 'Excellent course! Highly recommended ..', 'Good pace and level of detail.', 'I found this course very helpful for refreshing my skills in important SQL concepts as well as learning more about BigQuery. Data Studio section is a bit shallow. To instructors: You may consider another detailed visualization course.', 'Awesome course!', 'nice course', 'The course should involve more hands on exercises ', 'good', 'Great course for the right audience.', 'Worth the time spent.. Amazing tutor', 'Excelent, very clear explanations  ', 'Excellent. Thank you', 'sql and chart', 'Great insights to google cloud and there are some reviews on SQL ', 'An excellent course on BigQuery, supported SQL features and Data Studio for presenting prepared and filtered data. Thank you!', 'Excelent...', 'It would be great if one could practice in bigquery with the public data without consuming the free processing, just during the course. I would like to work to connect all the concepts up to this point and that would be easier if I had a token to use in google cloud platform so no money would be need.', 'UNIONS and JOINS were explained very well here thank you!']</reviews><reviewers>['By Paula P L S', 'By Joseline C S', 'By Arie H A', 'By Bill F', 'By William S', 'By Rui M', 'By Jose L C V', 'By SAYANTA S R', 'By Tanzir A', 'By Matthew O', 'By Serhan A', 'By Ivan S', 'By Oleg Z', 'By Ikenna U P', 'By Ekta M', 'By Akshaya', 'By Sudha', 'By Juan F O', 'By Martyns N', 'By qun', 'By paulapingkan', 'By Harold L M M', 'By HÃ©ctor N C S', 'By Juan D O', 'By Laith K']</reviewers><review_date>['Dec 31, 2018', 'Feb 21, 2019', 'Feb 27, 2019', 'Apr 04, 2019', 'Mar 12, 2019', 'Dec 22, 2018', 'Aug 25, 2018', 'Aug 15, 2018', 'Oct 18, 2018', 'Nov 08, 2018', 'Nov 08, 2018', 'Nov 20, 2018', 'Nov 20, 2018', 'Nov 15, 2018', 'Aug 20, 2018', 'Oct 01, 2018', 'Oct 15, 2018', 'Aug 07, 2018', 'Dec 31, 2017', 'Jun 03, 2018', 'Dec 10, 2017', 'Feb 14, 2018', 'Apr 20, 2018', 'Jun 19, 2018', 'Mar 28, 2018']</review_date></doc>

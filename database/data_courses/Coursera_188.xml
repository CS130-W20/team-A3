We'll learn how to convert timestamps of all types to common formats and perform date/time calculations. We'll select and perform the optimal JOIN for a data science inquiry and clean data within an analysis dataset by deduping, running quality checks, backfilling, and handling nulls. We'll learn how to segment and analyze data per segment using windowing functions and use case statements to execute conditional logic to address a data science inquiry. We'll also describe how to convert a query into a scheduled job and how to insert data into a date partition. Finally, given a predictive analysis need, we'll engineer a feature from raw data using the tools and skills we've built over the course. The real-world application of these skills will give you the framework for performing the analysis of an AB test.</course_introduction><course_category>Browse.Data Science.Data Analysis</course_category><course_tag>A/B Testing//Query String//Data Analysis//Predictive Analytics//SQL</course_tag><course_rating>4.3</course_rating><course_orgnization>University of California, Davis</course_orgnization><course_chapter>Data of Unknown Quality//Creating Clean Datasets//SQL Problem Solving//Case Study: AB Testing</course_chapter><course_sub_chapter>[['Course Introduction', 'Introduction of Data of Unknown Quality', 'Introduction to the Course Dataset', 'Error Codes (Solution)', 'Flexible Data Formats', 'Flexible Data Formats (Solution)', 'Identifying Unreliable Data + Nulls', 'Unreliable Data - Part 1 (Solution)', 'Unreliable Data -Part 2 (Solution)', 'Unreliable Data -  Part 3 (Solution)', 'Answering Ambiguous Questions', 'Users Table (Solution)'], ['Creating Clean Datasets Introduction', 'Tools of the Trade: Coding Guide with Sublime Text (Optional)', 'Data Types', 'What is a Dependency?', 'Create a View-Item Table', 'Turn a Clean Query Into a Table (Activity/Solution)', 'Hierarchy of Data', 'Create User Info Table', 'Create a User Snapshot Table (Activity/Solution)', 'Partitions in Hive (Optional)'], ['Introduction to SQL Problem Solving', 'Map Out Your Joins', 'Test Queries vs Final Queries', 'Example: Create an Aggregate Table with a Rolling Date Period', 'Rolling Orders (Solution)', "Find Each User's Most Recently Viewed Page for an Email Campaign", 'Review Windowing Functions', 'Promo Email (Solution)', 'Product Analysis', 'Product Analysis (Solution)', 'Coding with Style'], ['How is AB Testing Used?', 'Statistics Refresher (Optional)', 'Test Assignments', 'Test Assignments (Solution)', 'Create a New Metric', 'Creating a New Metric (Solution)', 'Analyze Results', 'Analyzing Results (Solution)', 'Peer Review Overview', 'Course Summary']]</course_sub_chapter><course_time>Approx. 20 hours to complete</course_time><reviews>['The instructor is very smart and her syllabus is very easy to follow. The real life examples are great and helps put ideas in perspective! I would definitely recommend this course and already have!', 'Lots of "oh wait, let me catch my own mistakes" on the videos. It appears to be sloppy, rather than a "teaching moment" for how one might debug the query.']</reviews><reviewers>['By Shriti P', 'By Michael P']</reviewers><review_date>['Jul 30, 2019', 'Aug 13, 2019']</review_date></doc>

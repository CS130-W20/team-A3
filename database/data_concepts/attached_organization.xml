The classification was created when the amendments to the National Government Organization Act&#160;[ja] were promulgated on July 1, 1984. The amendments, in particular, made it clear that the National Police Agency is an extraordinary organ attached to the National Public Safety Commission, which is an external organ of the Cabinet Office.

Replication in computing can refer to:
Replication in space or in time is often linked to scheduling algorithms.[1]
Access to a replicated entity is typically uniform with access to a single non-replicated entity. The replication itself should be transparent to an external user. In a failure scenario, a failover of replicas should be hidden as much as possible with respect to quality of service.[2]

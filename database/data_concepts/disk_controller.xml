Also it provides an interface between the disk drive and the bus connecting it to the rest of the system.
Early disk controllers were identified by their storage methods and data encoding.  They were typically implemented on a separate controller card. Modified frequency modulation (MFM) controllers were the most common type in small computers, used for both floppy disk and hard disk drives. Run length limited (RLL) controllers used data compression to increase storage capacity by about 50%.  Priam created a proprietary storage algorithm that could double the disk storage.  Shugart Associates Systems Interface (SASI) was a predecessor to SCSI. 
Modern disk controllers are integrated into the disk drive as peripheral controllers. For example, disks called "SCSI disks" have built-in SCSI controllers. In the past, before most SCSI controller functionality was implemented in a single chip, separate SCSI controllers interfaced disks to the SCSI bus.
These integrated peripheral controllers communicate with a host controller in the host system over a standardized, high-level storage bus interface. The most common types of interfaces provided nowadays by disk controllers are PATA (IDE) and Serial ATA for home use. High-end disks use Parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel or Serial Attached SCSI.

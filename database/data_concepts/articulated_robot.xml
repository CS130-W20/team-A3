<doc><id>articulated_robot</id><concept_name>articulated robot</concept_name><wiki>An articulated robot is a robot with rotary joints[citation needed] (e.g. a legged robot or an industrial robot).  Articulated robots can range from simple two-jointed structures to systems with 10 or more interacting joints and materials.
They are powered by a variety of means, including electric motors.
Some types of robots, such as robotic arms, can be articulated or non-articulated. [1][2]

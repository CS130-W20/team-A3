The name of rainbow comes from Rubinstein (1991)[2], who emphasises that this option was based on a combination of various assets like a rainbow is a combination of various colors. More generally, rainbow options are multiasset options, also referred to as correlation options, or basket options. Rainbow can take various other forms but the combining idea is to have a payoff that is depending on the assets sorted by their performance at maturity. When the rainbow only pays the best (respectively worst) performing asset of the basket, it is also called best-of, (respectively worst-of). Other popular options that can be reformulated as a rainbow option are spread and exchange options.[3]
Rainbow options are usually calls or puts on the best or worst of n underlying assets.[4] Like basket option, which is written on a group of assets  and pays out on a weighted-average gain on the basket as a whole, a rainbow option also considers a group of assets, but usually pays out on the level of one of them. [5]
A simple example is a call rainbow option written on  FTSE 100, Nikkei and S&amp;P 500  which will pay out the difference between the strike price and the level of the index that has risen by the largest amount of the three. [5]

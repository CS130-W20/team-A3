They are used to read questionnaires, multiple choice examination paper in the form of lines or shaded areas.
Many traditional OMR devices work with a dedicated scanner device that shines a beam of light onto the form paper. The contrasting reflectivity at predetermined positions on a page is then used to detect these marked areas because they reflect less light than the blank areas of the paper.
Some OMR devices use forms that are preprinted onto "transoptic" paper and measure the amount of light which passes through the paper; thus a mark on either side of the paper will reduce the amount of light passing through the paper.
In contrast to the dedicated OMR device, desktop OMR software allows a user to create their own forms in a word processor and print them on a laser printer. The OMR software then works with a common desktop image scanner with a document feeder to process the forms once filled out.

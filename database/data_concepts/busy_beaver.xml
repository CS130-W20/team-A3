More precisely, the busy beaver game consists of designing a halting, binary-alphabet Turing machine which writes the most 1s on the tape, using only a given set of states. The rules for the 2-state game are as follows:
A player should conceive a transition table aiming for the longest output of 1s on the tape while making sure the machine will halt eventually.
An nth busy beaver, BB-n or simply "busy beaver" is a Turing machine that wins the n-state Busy Beaver Game. That is, it attains the largest number of 1s among all other possible n-state competing Turing Machines. The BB-2 Turing machine, for instance, achieves four 1s in six steps.

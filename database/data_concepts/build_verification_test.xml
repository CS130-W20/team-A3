Smoke tests are a subset of test cases that cover the most important functionality of a component or system, used to aid assessment of whether main functions of the software appear to work correctly.[1][2] When used to determine if a computer program should be subjected to further, more fine-grained testing, a smoke test may be called an intake test.[1] Alternately, it is a set of tests run on each new build of a product to verify that the build is testable before the build is released into the hands of the test team.[5] In the DevOps paradigm, use of a BVT step is one hallmark of the continuous integration maturity stage.[6]
For example, a smoke test may address basic questions like "does the program run?", "does the user interface open?", or "does clicking the main button do anything?" The process of smoke testing aims to determine whether the application is so badly broken as to make further immediate testing unnecessary. As the book Lessons Learned in Software Testing[7] puts it, "smoke tests broadly cover product features in a limited time [...] if key features don't work or if key bugs haven't yet been fixed, your team won't waste further time installing or testing".[3]
Smoke tests frequently run quickly, giving benefits of faster feedback, rather than running more extensive test suites, which would naturally take much longer.
A daily build and smoke test is among industry best practices.[8][need quotation to verify] Smoke testing is also done by testers before accepting a build for further testing. Microsoft claims that after code reviews, "smoke testing is the most cost-effective method for identifying and fixing defects in software".[9]

In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object diagram focuses on some particular set of objects and attributes, and the links between these instances. A correlated set of object diagrams provides insight into how an arbitrary view of a system is expected to evolve over time. In early UML specifications the object diagram is described as:
The latest UML 2.5 specification does not explicitly define object diagrams,[3] but provides a notation for instances of classifiers.[4]
Object diagrams and class diagrams are closely related[5] and use almost identical notation.[6] Both diagrams are meant to visualize static structure of a system. While class diagrams show classes, object diagrams display instances of classes (objects).[7] Object diagrams are more concrete than class diagrams. They are often used to provide examples or act as test cases for class diagrams. Only aspects of current interest in a model are typically shown on an object diagram.

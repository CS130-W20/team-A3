It is named after Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman, colleagues at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). Sobel and Feldman presented the idea of an "Isotropic 3x3 Image Gradient Operator" at a talk at SAIL in 1968.[1] Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Sobel&#8211;Feldman operator is either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Sobel&#8211;Feldman operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer-valued filter in the horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. On the other hand, the gradient approximation that it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high-frequency variations in the image.
The operator uses two 3&#215;3 kernels which are convolved with the original image to calculate approximations of the derivatives &#8211; one for horizontal changes, and one for vertical. If we define A as the source image, and Gx and Gy are two images which at each point contain the vertical and horizontal derivative approximations respectively, the computations are as follows:[2]

Since the Sobel kernels can be decomposed as the products of an averaging and a differentiation
kernel, they compute the gradient with smoothing. For example,

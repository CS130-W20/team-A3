<doc><id>recommender_system</id><concept_name>recommender system</concept_name><wiki>A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.[1][2] They are primarily used in commercial applications.
Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.[3] These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts,[4] collaborators,[5] and financial services.[6]
Recommender systems usually make use of either or both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering (also known as the personality-based approach),[7] as well as other systems such as knowledge-based systems. Collaborative filtering approaches build a model from a user's past behavior (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.[8] Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete, pre-tagged characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.[9] Current recommender systems typically combine one or more approaches into a hybrid system.
The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two early music recommender systems &#8211; Last.fm and Pandora Radio.

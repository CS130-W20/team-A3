The specification of what types of transfers are excluded varies in the closed systems of physics, chemistry or engineering.
In nonrelativistic classical mechanics, a closed system is a physical system that doesn't exchange any matter with its surroundings, and isn't subject to any net force whose source is external to the system.[1][2] A closed system in classical mechanics would be equivalent to an isolated system in thermodynamics. Closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of specific problem or experiment.
In thermodynamics, a closed system can exchange energy (as heat or work) but not matter, with its surroundings.
An isolated system cannot exchange any heat, work, or matter with the surroundings, while an open system can exchange energy and matter.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] (This scheme of definition of terms is not uniformly used, though it is convenient for some purposes. In particular, some writers use 'closed system' where 'isolated system' is used here.[10][11])
For a simple system, with only one type of particle (atom or molecule), a closed system amounts to a constant number of particles. However, for systems which are undergoing a chemical reaction, there may be all sorts of molecules being generated and destroyed by the reaction process. In this case, the fact that the system is closed is expressed by stating that the total number of each elemental atom is conserved, no matter what kind of molecule it may be a part of.

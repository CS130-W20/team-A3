Money creation, or money issuance, is the process by which the money supply of a country, or of an economic or monetary region,[note 1] is increased. In most modern economies, most of the money supply is in the form of bank deposits.[1] Central banks monitor the amount of money in the economy by measuring the so-called monetary aggregates.[note 2]
The term "money supply" commonly denotes the total, safe, financial assets that households and businesses can use to make payments or to hold as short-term investment.[2] The money supply is measured using the so-called "monetary aggregates", defined in accordance to their respective level of liquidity: In the United States, for example, M0 for currency in circulation; M1 for M0 plus transaction deposits at depository institutions, such as drawing accounts at banks; M2 for M1 plus savings deposits, small-denomination time deposits, and retail money-market mutual fund shares.[2]
The money supply is understood to increase through activities by government authorities,[note 3] by the central bank of the nation,[3] and by commercial banks.[4]

It comes from ethnographic research[1][2] It is a method of discourse analysis in linguistics that draws on the anthropological field of ethnography. Unlike ethnography proper, though, EOC takes into account both the communicative form, which may include but is not limited to spoken language, and its function within the given culture.[2]
General aims of this qualitative research method include being able to discern which communication acts and/or codes are important to different groups, what types of meanings groups apply to different communication events, and how group members learn these codes, in order to provide insight into particular communities.  This additional insight may be used to enhance communication with group members, make sense of group members&#8217; decisions, and distinguish groups from one another, among other things.
Dell Hymes proposed the ethnography of communication as an approach towards analyzing patterns of language use within speech communities, in order to provide support for his idea of communicative competence, which itself was a reaction to Noam Chomsky's distinction between linguistic competence and linguistic performance.[3]
Originally coined "ethnography of speaking" in Dell Hymes' eponymous 1962 paper,[4] it was redefined in his 1964 paper, Introduction: Toward Ethnographies of Communication to accommodate for the non-vocal and non-verbal characteristics of communication,[1] although most EOC researchers still tend to focus upon speaking as it is generally considered "to be a prominent - even primordial - means of communication."[5]

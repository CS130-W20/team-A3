There is a consensus that the processes involved are extensions of standard software engineering processes.[1] Considering this, along with its unique characteristics, popular frameworks used include the spiral approach and business-oriented approach to application development, among other models that address the requirements for an iterative process.[1]
Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market, or technical complexity is a concern, documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk.
A study conducted involving web engineering practice revealed that web application development has several characteristics that have to be addressed and these include: short development life-cycle times; different business models; multi-disciplinary development teams; small development teams working on similar tasks; business analysis and evaluation with end-users; explicit requirement and rigorous training against requirements; and, maintenance.[1]
Some of the technologies used include: Ajax, ASP, ASP.NET, ActionScript, CSS, ColdFusion, CGI, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Visual LANSA, Lasso, Node.js, OSGI, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Xojo.

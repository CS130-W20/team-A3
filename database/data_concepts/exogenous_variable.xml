<doc><id>exogenous_variable</id><concept_name>exogenous variable</concept_name><wiki>In an economic model, an exogenous variable is one whose value is determined outside the model and is imposed on the model, and an exogenous change is a change in an exogenous variable.[1]:p. 8[2]:p. 202[3]:p. 8
In contrast, an endogenous variable is a variable whose value is determined by the model. An endogenous change is a change in an endogenous variable in response to an exogenous change that is imposed upon the model.[1]:p. 8[3]:p. 8
In econometrics, an exogenous variable is assumed to be fixed in repeated sampling, which means it is a nonstochastic variable. An implication of this assumption is that the error term in the econometric model is independent of the exogenous variable.[4]
In the simple supply and demand model, a change in consumer tastes is unexplained by the model and imposes an exogenous change in demand that leads to a change in the endogenous equilibrium price and the endogenous equilibrium quantity transacted. Here the exogenous variable is a parameter conveying consumer tastes. Similarly, a change in the consumer's income is exogenously given, outside the model, and appears in the model as an exogenous change in demand.[1]:p. 10

Requirements engineering (RE)[1] is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements[2] in the engineering design process. It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering.
The first use of the term requirements engineering was probably in 1964 in the conference paper "Maintenance, Maintainability, and System Requirements Engineering",[3] but it did not come into general use until the late 1990s with the publication of an IEEE Computer Society tutorial[4] in March 1997 and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the International Requirements Engineering Conference.

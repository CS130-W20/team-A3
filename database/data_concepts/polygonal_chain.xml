 called its vertices. The curve itself consists of the line segments connecting the consecutive vertices. 
A polygonal chain may also be called a polygonal curve,[1] polygonal path,[2] polyline,[3] piecewise linear curve,[3] broken line[4] or, in geographic information systems, a linestring or linear ring.[5]
A simple polygonal chain is one in which only consecutive (or the first and the last) segments intersect and only at their endpoints.
A closed polygonal chain is one in which the first vertex coincides with the last one, or, alternatively, the first and the last vertices are also connected by a line segment.[6] A simple closed polygonal chain in the plane is the boundary of a simple polygon. Often the term "polygon" is used in the meaning of "closed polygonal chain", but in some cases it is important to draw a distinction between a polygonal area and a polygonal chain.

In recent decades it has expanded into northern Xinjiang.[2] It forms part with Central Plains Mandarin (&#20013;&#21407;&#23448;&#35805;).[3] The name is a compound of the capitals of the two former provinces where it dominates, Lanzhou and Yinchuan, which are also two of its principal subdialects.
Among Chinese Muslims, it was sometimes written in the Arabic alphabet instead of Chinese characters.

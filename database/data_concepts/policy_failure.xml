Jessop argues for conceiving governance as a provider of flexibility for decision-making structures opposed to rigid state bureaucracy or market laws. From this approach failures would equate to failures of the governance structure.[1] According to him new constellations of governance may compensate for state failure.[2]
Peters and Pierre state that it is the continuous task of government to adapt to growing complexity.[2]
Dixon and Dogan write that constructive governance discourses are creative opportunities for people with disparate governance perspectives to find solutions to threatening governance failure.[3]

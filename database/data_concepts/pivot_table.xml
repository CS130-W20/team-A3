<doc><id>pivot_table</id><concept_name>pivot table</concept_name><wiki>A pivot table is a table of statistics that summarizes the data of a more extensive table (such as from a database, spreadsheet, or business intelligence program). This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together in a meaningful way.
Pivot tables are a technique in data processing. They arrange and rearrange (or "pivot") statistics in order to draw attention to useful information.
Although pivot table is a generic term, Microsoft trademarked PivotTable in the United States in 1994.[1]
In their book Pivot Table Data Crunching,[2] Bill Jelen and Mike Alexander refer to Pito Salas as the "father of pivot tables". While working on a concept for a new program that would eventually become Lotus Improv, Salas noted that spreadsheets have patterns of data. A tool that could help the user recognize these patterns would help to build advanced data models quickly. With Improv, users could define and store sets of categories, then change views by dragging category names with the mouse. This core functionality would provide the model for pivot tables.

<doc><id>eye_tracking</id><concept_name>eye tracking</concept_name><wiki>Eye tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.  An eye tracker is a device for measuring eye positions and eye movement.  Eye trackers are used in research on the visual system, in psychology, in psycholinguistics, marketing, as an input device for human-computer interaction, and in product design.  
Eye trackers are also being increasingly used for rehabilitative and assistive applications (related for instance to control of wheel chairs, robotic arms and prostheses).
There are a number of methods for measuring eye movement.  The most popular variant uses video images from which the eye position is extracted.  Other methods use search coils or are based on the electrooculogram.
In the 1800s, studies of eye movement were made using direct observations.[citation needed]
In 1879 in Paris, Louis &#201;mile Javal observed that reading does not involve a smooth sweeping of the eyes along the text, as previously assumed, but a series of short stops (called fixations) and quick saccades.[1]  This observation raised important questions about reading, questions which were explored during the 1900s: On which words do the eyes stop? For how long? When do they regress to already seen words?
Edmund Huey[2] built an early eye tracker, using a sort of contact lens with a hole for the pupil. The lens was connected to an aluminum pointer that moved in response to the movement of the eye. Huey studied and quantified regressions (only a small proportion of saccades are regressions), and he showed that some words in a sentence are not fixated.

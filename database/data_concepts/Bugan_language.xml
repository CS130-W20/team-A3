There are about 3000 speakers, mostly in some villages in southern Guangnan (&#24191;&#21335;) and northern Xichou (&#35199;&#30068;), Yunnan Province, China. Bugan is an analytic language, and word order and auxiliary words have important functions in the grammar.[4]
According to Li Jinfang (1996), the Bugan-speaking population is distributed in seven villages across southern Guangnan (&#24191;&#21335;) and northern Xichou (&#35199;&#30068;), Yunnan Province, China. As the language is highly uniform, it is not divided into any dialects.
According to a more recent survey by Li Yunbing (2005), the Bugan people, comprising a total of 500+ households and 2,700+ individuals, live in the following locations.
Li Yunbing also uses the term B&#249;g&#275;ng (&#24067;&#36179;) in place of B&#249;g&#257;n (&#24067;&#29976;).

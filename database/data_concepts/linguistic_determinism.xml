<doc><id>linguistic_determinism</id><concept_name>linguistic determinism</concept_name><wiki>Linguistic determinism is the idea that language and its structures limit and determine human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as categorization, memory, and perception. The term implies that people who speak different languages as their mother tongues have different thought processes.[1]
Linguistic determinism is the strong form of linguistic relativity (popularly known as the Sapir&#8211;Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use. Guy Deutscher is one example of a linguistic relativist who maintains that language influences worldview.[2]
Friedrich Nietzsche lived before the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was formulated, however, many of his views line up with the assumptions of linguistic determinism. He is credited with the term "Language as a prison".[3] Alfred Korzybski also supports the hypothesis inadvertently through general semantics.[4]
The language that served as the basis of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is Hopi, specifically its notion of time.[5] Later support for determinism comes from Pirah&#227; language, which is known for lacking a numerical system.[6]

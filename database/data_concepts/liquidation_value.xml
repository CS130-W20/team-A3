Liquidation value is typically lower than fair market value. Unlike cash or securities, certain illiquid assets, like real estate, often require a period of several months in order to obtain their fair market value in a sale, and will generally sell for a significantly lower price if a sale is forced to occur in a shorter time period.  Liquidation value may be either the result of a forced liquidation or an orderly liquidation.  Either value assumes that the sale is consummated by a seller who is compelled to sell and assumes an exposure period which is less than market normal.

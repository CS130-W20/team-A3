A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule, named after its inventor, Henry Gantt (1861&#8211;1919), who designed such a chart around the years 1910&#8211;1915.[1][2] Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency relationships between activities and current schedule status.
A Gantt chart, or harmonogram, is a type of bar chart[3][4] that illustrates a project schedule.[5] This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis.[3][6] The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.[6][7] Gantt charts illustrate the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements constitute the work breakdown structure of the project. Modern Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line as shown here.
Gantt charts are sometimes equated with bar charts.[7][8]

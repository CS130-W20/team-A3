<doc><id>cognitive_linguistics</id><concept_name>cognitive linguistics</concept_name><wiki>Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.[1] It is an approach to linguistic research which is surrounded by scientific and terminological controversy; there is no general consensus on what is specifically meant with the term &#8217;cognitive linguistics&#8217;.[2][3]
The roots of cognitive linguistics are in Noam Chomsky&#8217;s 1959 critical review of B. F. Skinner&#8217;s Verbal Behavior. Chomsky's rejection of behavioural psychology and his subsequent anti-behaviourist activity helped bring about a shift of focus from empiricism to mentalism in psychology under the new concepts of cognitive psychology and cognitive science.[4]
Chomsky considered linguistics as a subfield of cognitive science in the 1970s but called his model transformational or generative grammar. Having been defeated by Chomsky in the linguistic wars,[5] George Lakoff united with Ronald Langacker and other advocates of neo-Darwinian linguistics in a so-called &#8221;Lakoff&#8212;Langacker agreement&#8221; in the early 1980s. It is claimed that the name &#8221;cognitive linguistics&#8221; was picked to undermine Chomsky&#8217;s fame as a cognitive scientist.[6]
Consequently, there are three competing approaches that today consider themselves as true representatives of cognitive linguistics. One is the Lakoffian&#8212;Langackerian brand with capitalised initials (Cognitive Linguistics). The second is generative grammar, while the third approach is proposed by scholars whose work falls outside the scope of the other two. They argue that cognitive linguistics should not be taken as the name of a specific selective framework, but as a whole field of scientific research that is assessed by its evidential rather than theoretical value.[3]

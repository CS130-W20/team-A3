out under the same conditions of measurement. [2] In other words, the measurements are taken by a single person or instrument on the same item, under the same conditions, and in a short period of time. A less-than-perfect test&#8211;retest reliability causes test&#8211;retest variability. Such variability can be caused by, for example, intra-individual variability and intra-observer variability. A measurement may be said to be repeatable when this variation is smaller than a pre-determined acceptance criterion.
Test&#8211;retest variability is practically used, for example, in medical monitoring of conditions. In these situations, there is often a predetermined "critical difference", and for differences in monitored values that are smaller than this critical difference, the possibility of pre-test variability as a sole cause of the difference may be considered in addition to, for examples, changes in diseases or treatments.[3]
The following conditions need to be fulfilled in the establishment of repeatability: [2][4]
Repeatability methods were developed by Bland and Altman (1986).[5]

R&amp;D activities differ from institution to institution, with two primary models[1] of an R&amp;D department either staffed by engineers and tasked with directly developing new products, or staffed with industrial scientists and tasked with applied research in scientific or technological fields, which may facilitate future product development. R&amp;D differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment. However R&amp;D is crucial for acquiring larger shares of the market through the marketisation of new products.[1]
New product design and development is often a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In a global industrial landscape that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary as well due to the fierce competition and the evolving preferences of consumers. Without an R&amp;D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others.
A system driven by marketing is one that puts the customer needs first, and produces goods that are known to sell.[2] Market research is carried out, which establishes the needs of consumers and the potential niche market of a new product. If the development is technology driven, R&amp;D is directed toward developing products to meet the unmet needs.[citation needed]

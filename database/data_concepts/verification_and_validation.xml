Verification and validation are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose.[1] These are critical components of a quality management system such as ISO 9000. The words "verification" and "validation" are sometimes preceded with "independent", indicating that the verification and validation is to be performed by a disinterested third party. "Independent verification and validation" can be abbreviated as "IV&amp;V".
In practice, as quality management terms, the definitions of verification and validation can be inconsistent.  Sometimes they are even used interchangeably.[2][3][4]
However, the PMBOK guide, a standard adopted by the  Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), defines them as follows in its 4th edition:[5]
Verification is intended to check that a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) meets a set of design specifications.[6][7] In the development phase, verification procedures involve performing special tests to model or simulate a portion, or the entirety, of a product, service or system, then performing a review or analysis of the modeling results. In the post-development phase, verification procedures involve regularly repeating tests devised specifically to ensure that the product, service, or system continues to meet the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations as time progresses.[7][8] It is a process that is used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system complies with regulations, specifications, or conditions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can be in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an internal process.

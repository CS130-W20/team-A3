<doc><id>Atayal_language</id><concept_name>Atayal language</concept_name><wiki>The Atayal language is spoken by the Atayal people of Taiwan. Squliq and C&#8217;uli&#8217; (Ts&#8217;ole&#8217;) are two major dialects. Mayrinax and Pa&#8217;kuali&#8217;, two subdialects of C&#8217;uli&#8217;, are unique among Atayal dialects in having male and female register distinctions in their vocabulary.
The language is recorded in an Atayal&#8211;English dictionary by S&#248;ren Egerod and several reference grammars. The Bible has been translated into Atayal and was published in 2002. Atayal is written in the Latin script.  Atayal was one of the source languages of Yilan Creole Japanese.
The Atayal language is most commonly written in the Latin script. &#10216;ng&#10217; represents the velar nasal /&#331;/, and the apostrophe &#10216;'&#10217; represents the glottal stop. In some literature, &#10216;&#7731;&#10217; is used to represent /q/ and &#10216;&#269; &#353; &#382;&#10217; are used to represent /t&#643; &#643; &#658;/.
In some dialects but not all, schwa /&#601;/ is frequently omitted in writing, resulting in long consonant clusters on the surface (e.g. pspngun /p&#601;s&#601;p&#601;&#331;un/).[3]

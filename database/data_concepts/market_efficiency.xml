The efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a hypothesis in financial economics that states that asset prices reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.  Since risk adjustment is central to the EMH, and yet the EMH does not specify a model of risk, the EMH is untestable.[1]  As a result, research in financial economics since at least the 1990s has focused on market anomalies, that is, deviations from specific models of risk.[2]
The idea that financial market returns are difficult to predict goes back to Bachelier (1900),[3] Mandelbrot (1963),[4] and Samuelson (1965).[5] Eugene Fama is closely associated with the EMH, in part due to his influential 1970 review of the theoretical and empirical research (Fama 1970).[1]
Despite its lack of testability, the EMH still provides the basic logic for modern risk-based theories of asset prices.  Indeed, modern frameworks such as consumption-based asset pricing and intermediary asset pricing can be thought of as the combination of a model of risk with the hypothesis that markets are efficient.[6]

Service robots assist human beings, typically by performing a job that is dirty, dull, distant, dangerous or repetitive, including household chores. They typically are autonomous and/or operated by a built-in control system, with manual override options.
The term "service robot" does not have a strict technical definition. The International Organization for Standardization defines a &#8220;service robot&#8221; as a robot &#8220;that performs useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation applications&#8221;.[1]
According to ISO 8373 robots require &#8220;a degree of autonomy&#8221;, which is the &#8220;ability to perform intended tasks based on current state and sensing, without human intervention&#8221;. For service robots this ranges from partial autonomy - including human robot interaction - to full autonomy - without active human robot intervention. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) statistics for service robots therefore include systems based on some degree of human robot interaction or even full tele-operation as well as fully autonomous systems.
Service robots are categorized according to personal or professional use. They have many forms and structures as well as application areas.
The possible applications of robots to assist in human chores is widespread. At present there are a few main categories that these robots fall into.

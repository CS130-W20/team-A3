Market concentration, a related metric, measures the degree to which a comparatively small number of firms accounts for a large proportion of the market. These metrics are useful in comparing a firm&#8217;s or a brand&#8217;s relative position across different markets and in evaluating the type and degree of competition in those markets.[1]
The purpose of the &#8220;relative market share metric&#8221; is to access a firm's or a brand's success and its position in the market. A firm with a market share of 25% would be a powerful leader in many markets but a distant &#8220;number two&#8221; in others. Relative market share offers a way to benchmark a firm's or a brand's share against that of its largest competitor, enabling managers to compare relative market positions across different product markets. Relative market share gains some of its significance from studies&#8211;albeit controversial ones&#8212;suggesting that major players in a market tend to be more profitable than their competitors.[1]
Relative market share can also be calculated by dividing brand sales by largest competitor sales because the common factor of total market sales (or revenue) cancels out.[1]

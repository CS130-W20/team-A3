It is a measure of the independence of a summit. A peak's key col (highest gap between two mountains) is a unique point on this contour line and the parent peak is some higher mountain, selected according to various criteria.
There are at least two (related) definitions of prominence:
The following mental exercise may illustrate the meaning of topographic prominence.  Imagine a peak and imagine that an imaginary sea level (based on an elevation above the geoid) rises to the peak.  Now slowly lower the imaginary sea level and an imaginary island appears beneath your feet.  The island will grow and will merge with other islands that emerge.  Eventually, the island will touch an island with a higher peak than the initial island (i.e., an imaginary island that existed before lowering the imaginary sea level.)  The summit of that island is the parent peak of the summit, the point at which the two islands touch is the key col of the summit, and the elevation rise from the key col to the summit is the topographic prominence of the summit.
The parent peak may be either close or far from the subject peak.  The summit of Mount Everest is the parent peak of Aconcagua in Argentina at a distance of 17,755&#160;km (11,032&#160;miles), as well as the parent of the South Summit of Mount Everest at a distance of 360&#160;m (1200&#160;feet).  The key col may also be close to the subject peak or far from it.  The key col for Aconcagua, if sea level is disregarded, is the Bering Strait at a distance of 13,655&#160;km (8,485&#160;miles).  The key col for the South Summit of Mount Everest is about 100&#160;m (330&#160;feet) distant.

<doc><id>structure_tensor</id><concept_name>structure tensor</concept_name><wiki>In mathematics, the structure tensor, also referred to as the second-moment matrix, is a matrix derived from the  gradient of a function.  It summarizes the predominant directions of the gradient in a specified neighborhood of a point, and the degree to which those directions are coherent.  The structure tensor is often used in image processing and computer vision.[1][2][3]
For a function 



I


{\displaystyle I}

 of two variables p = (x, y), the structure tensor is the 2&#215;2 matrix
where 




I

x




{\displaystyle I_{x}}

 and 




I

y




{\displaystyle I_{y}}

 are the partial derivatives of 



I


{\displaystyle I}

 with respect to x and y; the integrals range over the plane

{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}

; and w is some fixed "window function", a distribution on two variables.   Note that the matrix

{\displaystyle S_{w}}

 is itself a function of p = (x, y).
The formula above can be written also as

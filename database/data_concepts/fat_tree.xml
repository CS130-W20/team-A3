In a tree data structure, every branch has the same thickness, regardless of their place in the hierarchy&#8212;they are all "skinny" (skinny in this context means low-bandwidth). In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are "fatter" (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy. In a telecommunications network, the branches are data links; the varied thickness (bandwidth) of the data links allows for more efficient and technology-specific use.[citation needed]
Mesh and hypercube topologies have communication requirements that follow a rigid algorithm, and cannot be tailored to specific packaging technologies.[2]
Supercomputers that use a fat tree network[3] include the two fastest as of late 2018,[4] Summit[5] and Sierra,[6] as well as Tianhe-2,[7] the Meiko Scientific CS-2, Yellowstone, the Earth Simulator, the Cray X2, the Connection Machine CM-5, and various Altix supercomputers.[citation needed]

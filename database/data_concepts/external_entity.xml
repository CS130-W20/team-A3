<doc><id>external_entity</id><concept_name>external entity</concept_name><wiki>A data-flow diagram (DFD) is a way of representing a flow of a data of a process or a system (usually an information system). The DFD also provides information about the outputs and inputs of each entity and the process itself. A data-flow diagram has no control flow, there are no decision rules and no loops. Specific operations based on the data can be represented by a flowchart.[1]
There are several notations for displaying data-flow diagrams. The notation presented above was described in 1979 by Tom DeMarco as part of Structured Analysis.
For each data flow, at least one of the endpoints (source and / or destination) must exist in a process. The refined representation of a process can be done in another data-flow diagram, which subdivides this process into sub-processes.
The data-flow diagram is part of the structured-analysis modelling tools. When using UML, the activity diagram typically takes over the role of the data-flow diagram. A special form of data-flow plan is a site-oriented data-flow plan.

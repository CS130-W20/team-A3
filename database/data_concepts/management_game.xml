Business games may be carried out for various business training such as: general management, finance, organizational behaviour, human resources, etc. Often, the term "business simulation" is used with the same meaning.
A business game has been defined as "a game with a business environment that can lead to one or both of the following results: the training of players in business skills (hard and/or soft) or the evaluation of players' performances (quantitatively and/or qualitatively)".[1]
Business games are used as a teaching method in universities, and more particularly in business schools, but also for executive education.
Simulation are considered to be an innovative learning method (Aldrich 2004), and are often computer-based.

It is important for organizations and individuals to understand the implications linked to work-family conflict. In certain cases, work&#8211;family conflict has been associated with increased occupational burnout, job stress, decreased health, and issues pertaining to organizational commitment and job performance.[2]
Work-family conflict was first studied in the late 19th century.[3] During this time period, work and income moved from inside the home (agricultural work) to outside the home (factories).[3] Industrialization challenged the current relationship between working and family.[3]
Boundary theory and border theory are the foundations used to study work-family conflict.[3] Boundary theory divides social life into two interdependent sections, work and family. Individuals have different roles and responsibilities in each section.[3] Since the sections are interdependent, two roles cannot take place at the same time.[3] Individuals have to participate in role transformation between expectations of the workplace and expected roles within the family structure.[3]
Border theory expands this by considering the influences each section has on the other.[3] Border theory attempts to pin down ways to manage conflict and achieve balance between conflicting identities.[3] Individuals may choose to treat these segments separately, moving back and forth between work and family roles (displaying boundary theory) or can decide to integrate the segments with hopes of finding balance.[3]

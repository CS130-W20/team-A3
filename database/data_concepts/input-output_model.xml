In economics, an input&#8211;output model is a quantitative economic model that represents the interdependencies between different sectors of a national economy or different regional economies.[1] Wassily Leontief (1906&#8211;1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the Nobel Prize in Economics for his development of this model.[1]
Francois Quesnay had developed a cruder version of this technique called Tableau &#233;conomique, and L&#233;on Walras's work Elements of Pure Economics on general equilibrium theory also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief's seminal concept.[2]
Alexander Bogdanov has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes, in January 1921.[3] This approach was also developed by L. N. Kritsman and T. F. Remington, who has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay's tableau &#233;conomique and the subsequent contributions by Vladimir Groman and Vladimir Bazarov to Gosplan's method of material balance planning.[3]

<doc><id>upper_and_lower_bound</id><concept_name>upper and lower bound</concept_name><wiki>In mathematics, particularly in order theory, an upper bound of a subset S of some partially ordered set (K, &#8804;) is an element of K which is greater than or equal to every element of S.[1][2] Dually, a lower bound of S is defined to be an element of K which is less than or equal to every element of S. A set with an upper (respectively, lower) bound is said to be bounded from above (respectively below) by that bound. The terms bounded above (bounded below) are also used in the mathematical literature for sets that have upper (respectively lower) bounds.[3]
For example, 5 is a lower bound for the set S = {5, 8, 42, 34, 13934} (as a subset of the integers or of the real numbers, etc.), and so is 4. On the other hand, 6 is not a lower bound for S since it is not smaller than every element in S.
The set S = {42} has 42 as both an upper bound and a lower bound; all other numbers are either an upper bound or a lower bound for that S.
Every subset of the natural numbers has a lower bound, since the natural numbers satisfy the well-ordering principle and thus have a least element (0, or 1 depending on the exact definition of natural numbers). An infinite subset of the natural numbers cannot be bounded from above. An infinite subset of the integers may be bounded from below or bounded from above, but not both. An infinite subset of the rational numbers may or may not be bounded from below, and may or may not be bounded from above.

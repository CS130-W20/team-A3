A weight function is a mathematical device used when performing a sum, integral, or average to give some elements more "weight" or influence on the result than other elements in the same set. The result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average. Weight functions occur frequently in statistics and analysis, and are closely related to the concept of a measure.  Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called "weighted calculus"[1] and "meta-calculus".[2]
In the discrete setting, a weight function 




w
:
A
&#8594;



R



+





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle w\colon A\to {\mathbb {R} }^{+}}

 is a positive function defined on a discrete set 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, which is typically finite or countable.  The weight function 



w
(
a
)
:=
1


{\displaystyle w(a):=1}

 corresponds to the unweighted situation in which all elements have equal weight.  One can then apply this weight to various concepts.
If the function 




f
:
A
&#8594;


R





{\displaystyle \scriptstyle f\colon A\to {\mathbb {R} }}

 is a real-valued function, then the unweighted sum of 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 on 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 is defined as

<doc><id>diglossia</id><concept_name>diglossia</concept_name><wiki>In linguistics, diglossia (/da&#618;&#712;&#609;l&#594;si&#601;/) is a situation in which two dialects or languages are used by a single language community. In addition to the community's everyday or vernacular language variety (labeled "L" or "low" variety), a second, highly codified lect (labeled "H" or "high") is used in certain situations such as literature, formal education, or other specific settings, but not used normally for ordinary conversation.[1] In most cases, the H variety has no native speakers but various degrees of fluency of the community in which the two languages exist.
The high variety may be an older stage of the same language (as in medieval Europe, where Latin remained in formal use even as colloquial speech diverged), an unrelated language, or a distinct yet closely related present day dialect, for example Modern Standard Arabic alongside other varieties of Arabic; or Chinese, with Mandarin as the official, literary standard and local varieties of Chinese used in everyday communication. Other examples include literary Katharevousa versus spoken Demotic Greek; literary Tamil versus spoken Tamil, and Indonesian, with its Baku and Gaul forms;[2] and literary versus spoken Welsh.
The Garifuna language is unusual in that it has gender-based diglossia, with men and women having different words for the same concepts.
The Greek word &#948;&#953;&#947;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#963;&#943;&#945; (digl&#333;ssia) normally refers to bilingualism in general, but was first used in the specialized meaning explained by Emmanuel Rhoides in the prologue of his Parerga in 1885.  Some scholars cite that diglossia appeared when Muslim cities emerged during the early period of Islam.[3] The term was immediately adapted into French as diglossie by the Greek linguist and demoticist Ioannis Psycharis, with credit to Rhoides.

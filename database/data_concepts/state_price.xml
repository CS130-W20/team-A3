The price of this security is the state price of this particular state of the world. The state price vector is the vector of state prices for all states.[1][2][3] As such, any derivatives contract whose settlement value is a function of an underlying asset whose value is uncertain at contract date can be decomposed as a linear combination of its Arrow-Debreu securities, and thus as a weighted sum of its state prices.
The Arrow-Debreu model (also referred to as the Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie model or ADM model) is the central model in general equilibrium theory and uses state prices in the process of proving the existence of a unique general equilibrium.
Imagine a world where two states are possible tomorrow: peace (P) and war (W). Denote the random variable which represents the state as &#969;; denote tomorrow's random variable as &#969;1. Thus, &#969;1 can take two values: &#969;1=P and &#969;1=W. 
Let's imagine that:

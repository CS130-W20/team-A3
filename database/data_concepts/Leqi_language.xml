Although the endonym Lashi is often used by Western researchers, the people refer to themselves and their language as Lacid.[3] It is according to Nishi (1999: 70) in the Maruic branch, which preserves the preglottalized initials of Proto-Burmish in the most phonotactic environments.
Data on Lashi is available in the followining publications (A Literature Review on Segments in Lacid (Lashi) Noftz 2017,) (Luce 1985: Charts S, T, V; Huang et al. 1992; Wannemacher 1995-7, as cited in Mann 1998, and Yabu 1988).
There are conflicting reports about the size of the Lacid population. Reports range from 30,000 to 60,000. [4]In China, Lashi (Leqi) speakers are distributed in Mangshi City (formerly Luxi County), Ruili City, Longchuan County, and Yingjiang County of western Yunnan province (Dai 2007:5). Mangshi has the most Lashi speakers, who are distributed in the following townships.
Lashi is also spoken in eastern Shan State, Burma. Lashi was originally spoken in the downstream area of the Ngochang Hka river valley, a tributary of the N&#8217;Mai Hka river, while Ngochang was originally spoken in the upstream area of the Ngochang Hka river valley.[5]

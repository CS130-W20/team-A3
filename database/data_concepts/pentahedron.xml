<doc><id>pentahedron</id><concept_name>pentahedron</concept_name><wiki>In geometry, a pentahedron (plural: pentahedra) is a polyhedron with five faces or sides. There are no face-transitive polyhedra with five sides and there are two distinct topological types.
With regular polygon faces, the two topological forms are the square pyramid and triangular prism.
The square pyramid can be seen as a triangular prism where one edge of its side edges is collapsed into a point, losing one edge and one vertex, and changing two squares into triangles.
Geometric variations with irregular faces can also be constructed.

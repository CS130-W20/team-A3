<doc><id>proprietary_protocol</id><concept_name>proprietary protocol</concept_name><wiki>In telecommunications, a proprietary protocol is a communications protocol owned by a single organization or individual.[1]
Ownership by a single organization gives the owner the ability to place restrictions on the use of the protocol and to change the protocol unilaterally. Specifications for proprietary protocols may or may not be published, and implementations are not freely distributed. Proprietors may enforce restrictions through control of the intellectual property rights, for example through enforcement of patent rights, and by keeping the protocol specification a [[tr[[]]ade secret]].  Some proprietary protocols strictly limit the right to create an implementation; others are widely implemented by entities that do not control the intellectual property but subject to restrictions the owner of the intellectual property may seek to impose.
The Skype protocol is a proprietary protocol.[2]
The Venturi Transport Protocol (VTP) is a patented proprietary protocol[3] that is designed to replace TCP transparently in [[]]order to overcome perceived inefficiencies related to wireless data transport.

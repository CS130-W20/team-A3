It can be thought of as an alternative way of expressing probability, much like odds or log-odds, but which has particular mathematical advantages in the setting of information theory.
The Shannon information can be interpreted as quantifying the level of "surprise" of a particular outcome. As it is such a basic quantity, it also appears in several other settings, such as the length of a message needed to transmit the event given an optimal source coding of the random variable.
The Shannon information is closely related to information theoretic entropy, which is the expected value of the self-information of a random variable, quantifying how surprising the random variable is "on average." This is the average amount of self-information an observer would expect to gain about a random variable when measuring it. [1]
The information content can be expressed in various units of information, of which the most common is the "bit" (sometimes also called the "shannon"), as explained below.

Microsoft Silverlight (or simply Silverlight) is a deprecated[5] application framework for writing and running rich Internet applications, similar to Adobe Flash. A plugin for Silverlight is still available for some browsers. While early versions of Silverlight focused on streaming media, later versions supported multimedia, graphics, and animation and gave support to developers for CLI languages and development tools. Silverlight was also one of the two application development platforms for Windows Phone, but web pages using Silverlight did not run on the Windows Phone or Windows Mobile versions of Internet Explorer, as there was no Silverlight plugin for Internet Explorer on those platforms.[6]
From the initial launch in 2007, reviewers compared the product to Adobe's Flash.[7][8]
According to statowl.com, Microsoft Silverlight had a penetration of 64.2% in May 2011. Usage on July 2010 was 53.6%, whereas as of May&#160;2011[update] market leader Adobe Flash was installed on 95.3% of browsers, and Java was supported on 76.5% of browsers.[9] Support of these plugins is not mutually exclusive; one system can support all three. Not all Web sites require a browser plugin.

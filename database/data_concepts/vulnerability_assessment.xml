Examples of systems for which vulnerability assessments are performed include, but are not limited to, information technology systems, energy supply systems, water supply systems, transportation systems, and communication systems.  Such assessments may be conducted on behalf of a range of different organizations, from small businesses up to large regional infrastructures. Vulnerability from the perspective of disaster management means assessing the threats from potential hazards to the population and to infrastructure.
It may be conducted in the political, social, economic or environmental fields.
Vulnerability assessment has many things in common with risk assessment.  Assessments are typically performed according to the following steps:
"Classical risk analysis is principally concerned with investigating the risks surrounding a plant (or some other object), its design and operations.  Such analysis tends to focus on causes and the direct consequences for the studied object. Vulnerability analysis, on the other hand, focuses both on consequences for the object itself and on primary and secondary consequences for the surrounding environment.  It also concerns itself with the possibilities of reducing such consequences and of improving the capacity to manage future incidents." (L&#246;vkvist-Andersen, et al., 2004)  In general, a vulnerability analysis serves to "categorize key assets and drive the risk management process." (United States Department of Energy, 2002)1
In the United States, guides providing valuable considerations and templates for completing a vulnerability assessment are available from numerous agencies including the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Transportation, just to name a few.

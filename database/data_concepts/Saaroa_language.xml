The Saaroa live in the two villages of Taoyuan and Kaochung in Taoyuan District (Taoyuan Township), Kaohsiung City, Taiwan (Zeitoun &amp; Teng 2014).[4]
With fewer than 10 native speakers and an ethnic population of 400 people, Saaroa is considered critically endangered. Even among native speakers of the language, they use primarily Mandarin or Bunun in their daily lives. There is no longer an active speech community for Saaroa.[1]
When grouped according to grammar, Saaroa is most closely related to the other Formosan language (Tsou) and branches very early from Proto-Formosan language that defines the grouping.[5]

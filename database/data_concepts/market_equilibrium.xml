For example, in the standard text   perfect competition, equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal.[1] Market equilibrium in this case is a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers. This price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes, and quantity is called the "competitive quantity" or market clearing quantity. But,the concept of equilibrium in economics also applies to imperfectly competitive markets, where it takes the form of a Nash equilibrium.
Three basic properties of equilibrium in general have been proposed by Huw Dixon.[2] These are:
Equilibrium property P1: The behavior of agents is consistent.
Equilibrium property P2: No agent has an incentive to change its behavior.

<doc><id>virtual_page</id><concept_name>virtual page</concept_name><wiki>A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table.  It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system.  Similarly, a page frame is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped by the operating system.[1][2][3]
A transfer of pages between main memory and an auxiliary store, such as a hard disk drive, is referred to as paging or swapping.[4]
Page size is usually determined by the processor architecture. Traditionally, pages in a system had uniform size, such as 4,096 bytes. However, processor designs often allow two or more, sometimes simultaneous, page sizes due to its benefits. There are several points that can factor into choosing the best page size.[5]
A system with a smaller page size uses more pages, requiring a page table that occupies more space. For example, if a 232 virtual address space is mapped to 4&#160;KiB (212 bytes) pages, the number of virtual pages is 220&#160;= (232&#160;/ 212). However, if the page size is increased to 32&#160;KiB (215 bytes), only 217 pages are required. A multi-level paging algorithm can decrease the memory cost of allocating a large page table for each process by further dividing the page table up into smaller tables, effectively paging the page table.

Multiple FR-V processor cores, with even each single processor-core able to compute many instructions/operations in parallel are used for image- and video-processing. Storage- and display-interfaces and other modules are added and a digital signal processor (DSP) increases the number of simultaneous computations.
An on-chip 32-bit Fujitsu FR microcontroller (6th generation in 2011 introduced the dual-core ARM architecture) initiates and controls the operation and data transfers of all processors, modules and interfaces and can be seen as the main control unit of the camera. The Milbeaut is also used as an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or application-specific standard product (ASSP).
The 7th generation uses a 55&#160;nm low-power process (SuVolta) and ARM Cortex-A5 microcontroller.[6]

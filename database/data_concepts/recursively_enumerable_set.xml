<doc><id>recursively_enumerable_set</id><concept_name>recursively enumerable set</concept_name><wiki>In computability theory, traditionally called recursion theory, a set S of natural numbers is called recursively enumerable, computably enumerable, semidecidable,  provable or Turing-recognizable if:
Or, equivalently,
The first condition suggests why the term semidecidable is sometimes used; the second suggests why computably enumerable is used.    The abbreviations r.e. and c.e. are often used, even in print, instead of the full phrase.
In computational complexity theory, the complexity class containing all recursively enumerable sets is RE. In recursion theory, the lattice of r.e. sets under inclusion is denoted

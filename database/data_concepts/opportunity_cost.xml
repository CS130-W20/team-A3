<doc><id>opportunity_cost</id><concept_name>opportunity cost</concept_name><wiki>When an option is chosen from alternatives, the opportunity cost is the "cost" incurred by not enjoying the benefit associated with the best alternative choice.[1]  The New Oxford American Dictionary defines it as "the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen."[2]
In simple terms, opportunity cost is the benefit not received as a result of not selecting the next best option. 
Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics, and has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice".
[3] The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in attempts to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently.[4] Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost.
The opportunity cost of a product or service is the revenue that could be earned by its alternative use. In other words, opportunity cost is the cost of the next best alternative of a product or service. The meaning of the concept of opportunity cost can be explained with the help of following examples:
(1) The opportunity cost of the funds tied up in one's own business is the interest (or profits corrected for differences in risk) that could be earned on those funds in other ventures.
(2) The opportunity  cost of the time one puts into his own business is the salary he could earn in other occupations (with a correction for the relative psychic income in the two occupations).
(3) The opportunity cost of using a machine to produce one product is the earnings that would be possible from other products.

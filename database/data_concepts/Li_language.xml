<doc><id>Li_language</id><concept_name>Li language</concept_name><wiki>The Hlai languages (Chinese: &#40654;&#35821;; pinyin: L&#237; y&#468;) are a primary branch of the Kra&#8211;Dai language family spoken in the mountains of central and south-central Hainan in China, not to be confused with the colloquial name for the Leizhou branch of Min Chinese (Chinese: &#40654;&#35805;; pinyin: L&#237; hu&#224;). They include Cun, whose speakers are ethnically distinct.[3] A quarter of Hlai speakers are monolingual. None of the Hlai languages had a writing system until the 1950s, when the Latin script was adopted for Ha.
Norquest (2007) classifies the Hlai languages as follows.[4] Individual languages are highlighted in bold. There are some 750,000 Hlai speakers.
The Fuma &#24220;&#29595; dialect is spoken in one village north of Changcheng &#26124;&#22478;, Hainan. It had about 800 speakers in 1994.[5]
Jiamao &#21152;&#33538; (52,000) is an aberrant Kra-Dai language with a Hlai superstratum and a non-Hlai substratum.

<doc><id>cloud_security_alliance</id><concept_name>cloud security alliance</concept_name><wiki>Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is a not-for-profit organization with the mission to &#8220;promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within Cloud Computing, and to provide education on the uses of Cloud Computing to help secure all other forms of computing.&#8221;[1]
The CSA has over 80,000 individual members worldwide.[2]
CSA gained significant reputability in 2011 when the American Presidential Administration selected the CSA Summit as the venue for announcing the federal government&#8217;s cloud computing strategy.[3]
The CSA was formed in December 2008 as a coalition by individuals who saw the need to provide objective enterprise user guidance on the adoption and use of cloud computing.[4] Its initial work product Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing was put together in a Wiki-style by dozens of volunteers.[5]
In 2014, the Chairman of the Board of the CSA was Dave Cullinane, VP of Global Security and Privacy for Catalina Marketing, St Petersburg, Florida, and former CISO for eBay. Cullinane has said, "If you have an application exposed to the Internet that will allow people to make money, it will be probed."[6]

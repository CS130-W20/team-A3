The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard&#8211;Satterthwaite theorem. The theorem is named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values.  The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".[1]
In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:
Cardinal voting electoral systems are not covered by the theorem, as they convey more information than rank orders.[2][3] However, Gibbard's theorem extends Arrow's theorem for that case. The theorem can also be sidestepped by weakening the notion of independence.[citation needed]
The axiomatic approach Arrow adopted can treat all conceivable rules (that are based on preferences) within one unified framework. In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one. One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem.[4]

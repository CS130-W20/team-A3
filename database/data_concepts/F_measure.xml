It considers both the precision p and the recall r of the test to compute the score: p is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all positive results returned by the classifier, and r is the number of correct positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. 
The name F-measure is believed to be named after a different F function in Van Rijsbergen's book, when introduced to MUC-4. [1]
The traditional F-measure or balanced F-score (F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:
The general formula for positive real &#946;, where &#946; is chosen such that recall is considered &#946; times as important as precision, is:

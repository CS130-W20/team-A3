The deep web,[1] invisible web,[2] or hidden web[3] are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not indexed by standard  web search-engines. The opposite term to the deep web is the "surface web", which is accessible to anyone/everyone using the Internet.[4]  Computer-scientist Michael K. Bergman is credited with coining the term deep web in 2001 as a search-indexing term.[5]
The content of the deep web is hidden behind HTTP forms[6][7] and includes many very common uses such as web mail, online banking, private or otherwise restricted access social-media pages and profiles, some web forums that require registration for viewing content, and services that users must pay for, and which are protected by paywalls, such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers.
The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP address, but may require a password or other security access to get past public-website pages.

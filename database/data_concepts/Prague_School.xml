<doc><id>Prague_School</id><concept_name>Prague School</concept_name><wiki>The Prague school or Prague linguistic circle[1] was an influential[2] group of linguists, philologists and literary critics in Prague. Its proponents developed methods of structuralist literary analysis[3] and a theory of the standard language and of language cultivation during the years 1928&#8211;1939. The linguistic circle was founded in the Caf&#233; Derby in Prague, which is also where meetings took place during its first years.[4]
The Prague School has had a significant continuing influence on linguistics and semiotics. Following the Czechoslovak coup d'&#233;tat of 1948, the circle was disbanded in 1952, but the Prague School continued as a major force in linguistic functionalism (distinct from the Copenhagen school or English Firthian &#8212; later Hallidean &#8212; linguistics).  American scholar Dell Hymes cites his 1962 paper, "The Ethnography of Speaking," as the formal introduction of Prague functionalism to American linguistic anthropology.
[5] The Prague structuralists also had a significant influence on structuralist film theory, especially through the introduction of the ostensive sign.[6]
The Prague linguistic circle included the Russian &#233;migr&#233;s Roman Jakobson, Nikolai Trubetzkoy, and Sergei Karcevskiy, as well as the famous Czech literary scholars Ren&#233; Wellek and Jan Muka&#345;ovsk&#253;. The instigator of the circle, and its first president until his death in 1945, was the Czech linguist Vil&#233;m Mathesius.[7]
In 1929 the Circle promulgated its theses in a paper submitted to the First Congress of Slavists. "The programmatic 1929 Prague Theses, surely one of the most imposing linguistic edifices of the 20th century, incapsulated [sic] the functionalist credo."[8] In the late 20th century, English translations of the Circle's seminal works were published by the Czech linguist Josef Vachek in several collections.

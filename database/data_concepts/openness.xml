<doc><id>openness</id><concept_name>openness</concept_name><wiki>Openness is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on transparency and collaboration.[1][2] That is, openness refers to "accessibility of knowledge, technology and other resources; the transparency of action; the permeability of organisational structures; and the inclusiveness of participation"[2]. Openness can be said to be the opposite of closedness[2], central authority and secrecy[1].
Open government is the governing doctrine which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public oversight.[3]
Openness in government applies the idea of freedom of information to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work.[4]  Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.[4]
Open content and free content both refer to creative works that lack restrictions on how people can use, modify, and distribute them.[5][6][7]   The terms derive from open source software and free software, similar concepts that refer specifically to software.[8]

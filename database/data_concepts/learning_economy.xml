Modern economies can be characterised as learning economies in which knowledge is the crucial resource and learning is the most important process. Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure market economies, if such existed, would have severe problems in terms of learning and innovation. The 'learning economy' is a mixed economy in a fundamental sense.
In the public debate, knowledge is increasingly presented as the crucial factor in the development of both society and the economy. In a growing number of publications from the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development it is emphasised that citizens of EU member countries currently operate in &#8216;a knowledge-based economy&#8217;. For several reasons many prefer the term &#8216;the learning economy&#8217; in characterising the current phase of socio-economic development.[1]
In 2018 at the annual United Nations General Assembly, a decentralized Learning Economy blockchain protocol was proposed.[2][3]  It asserts that if "education was the new gold standard,"[4] a market economy could be built around it to catalyze and incentivize 21st century education. Blockchain has many applications in education including verifying the integrity of skills, returning the control of identity to the students, and defining research provenance.[5][6] In April of 2019, research was published at Harvard Kennedy School making a case for a new form of Economy Corporation (E-Corp) to govern this decentralized Learning Economy.[7][8][9]

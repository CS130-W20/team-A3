<doc><id>golden_parachute</id><concept_name>golden parachute</concept_name><wiki>A golden parachute is an agreement between a company and an employee (usually an upper executive) specifying that the employee will receive certain significant benefits if employment is terminated. These may include severance pay, cash bonuses, stock options, or other benefits. Most definitions specify the employment termination is as a result of a merger or takeover,[1][2][3] also known as "change-in-control benefits",[4] but more recently the term has been used to describe perceived excessive CEO (and other executives) severance packages unrelated to change in ownership (also known as a golden handshake).[5]
The first use of the term "golden parachute" is credited to a 1961 attempt by creditors to oust Howard Hughes from control of Trans World Airlines. The creditors provided Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. an employment contract that included a clause that would pay him money in the event that he lost his job.[6]
The use of golden parachutes expanded greatly in the early 1980s in response to the large increase in the number of takeovers and mergers.
In Europe the highest "change-in-control benefits" have been for French executives, as of 2006 according to a study by the Hay Group human resource management firm.[citation needed] French executives receive roughly the double of their salary and bonus in their golden parachute.[citation needed]

<doc><id>architectural_pattern</id><concept_name>architectural pattern</concept_name><wiki>An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.[1] Architectural patterns are similar to software design patterns but have a broader scope. The architectural patterns address various issues in software engineering, such as computer hardware performance limitations, high availability and minimization of a business risk. Some architectural patterns have been implemented within software frameworks.
Even though an architectural pattern conveys an image of a system, it is not an architecture. An architectural pattern is a concept that solves and delineates some essential cohesive elements of a software architecture. Countless different architectures may implement the same pattern and share the related characteristics. Patterns are often defined as "strictly described and commonly available".[2][3]
Following traditional building architecture, a 'software architectural style' is a specific method of construction, characterized by the features that make it notable.
Some treat architectural patterns and architectural styles as the same,[5] some treat styles as specializations of patterns. What they have in common is both patterns and styles are idioms for architects to use, they "provide a common language"[5] or "vocabulary"[4] with which to describe classes of systems.

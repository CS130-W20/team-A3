<doc><id>opencores</id><concept_name>opencores</concept_name><wiki>OpenCores is a community developing digital open-source hardware through electronic design automation, with a similar ethos as the free software movement. OpenCores hopes to eliminate redundant design work and slash development costs. A number of companies have been reported as adopting OpenCores IP in chips,[1][2] or as adjuncts to EDA tools.[3][4] OpenCores is also cited from time to time in the electronics press as an example of open source in the electronics hardware community.[5]
OpenCores has always been a commercially owned organization. In 2015, the core active users of OpenCores established the independent Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi Foundation), and registered the libreCores.org[6] website as the basis for all future development, independent of commercial control.
Damjan Lampret, one of the founders of OpenCores, stated on his website that it began in 1999.[7] The first public record of the new website and its objectives was in EE Times in 2000. [8] Then CNET News reported in 2001.[9] Through the following years it was supported by advertising and sponsorship, including by Flextronics.[1]
In mid-2007 an appeal was put out for a new backer,[10] and that November, Swedish design house ORSoC AB[11] agreed to take over maintenance of the OpenCores website.[12]

<doc><id>feature_vector</id><concept_name>feature vector</concept_name><wiki>In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.[1] Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition,  classification and regression. Features are usually numeric, but structural features such as strings and graphs are used in syntactic pattern recognition.
The concept of "feature" is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.
A set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a feature vector.  
An example of reaching a two-way classification[clarification needed] from a feature vector (related to the perceptron) consists of
calculating the scalar product between the feature vector and a vector of weights,
comparing the result with a threshold, and deciding the class based on the comparison.
Algorithms for classification from a feature vector include nearest neighbor classification, neural networks, and statistical techniques such as Bayesian approaches.
In character recognition, features may include histograms counting the number of black pixels along horizontal and vertical directions, number of internal holes, stroke detection and many others.

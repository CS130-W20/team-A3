The simplest method is to use finite difference approximations.
A simple two-point estimation is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points (x, f(x)) and (x&#160;+&#160;h, f(x&#160;+&#160;h)).[1] Choosing a small number h,  h represents a small change in x, and it can be either positive or negative.  The slope of this line is
This expression is Newton's difference quotient (also known as a first-order divided difference).

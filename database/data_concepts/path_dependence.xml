In economics and the social sciences, path dependence can refer either to outcomes at a single moment in time, or to long-run equilibria of a process. In common usage, the phrase implies either:
In the first usage, (A), "history matters" is trivially true in many contexts; everything has causes, and sometimes different causes lead to different outcomes. In these contexts, the direct influence of earlier states may not be notable,[4] unlike "path-dependent" options in finance, where the influence of history can be non-standard.
It is the narrow concept (B), that has the most explanatory force, and which is covered in this article.

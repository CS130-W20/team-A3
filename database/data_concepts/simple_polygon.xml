<doc><id>simple_polygon</id><concept_name>simple polygon</concept_name><wiki>In geometry, a simple polygon /&#712;p&#594;l&#618;&#609;&#594;n/ is a polygon that does not intersect itself and has no holes. That is, it is a flat shape consisting of straight, non-intersecting line segments or "sides" that are joined pairwise to form a single closed path. If the sides intersect then the polygon is not simple. The qualifier "simple" is frequently omitted, with the above definition then being understood to define a polygon in general.
The definition given above ensures the following properties:
Two edges meeting at a corner are usually required to form an angle that is not straight (180&#176;); otherwise, the collinear line segments will be considered parts of a single side.
Mathematicians typically use "polygon" to refer only to the shape made up by the line segments, not the enclosed region, however some may use "polygon" to refer to a plane figure that is bounded by a closed path, composed of a finite sequence of straight line segments (i.e., by a closed polygonal chain). According to the definition in use, this boundary may or may not form part of the polygon itself.[1]

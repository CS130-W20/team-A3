In signal processing, reconstruction usually means the determination of an original continuous signal from a sequence of equally spaced samples.
This article takes a generalized abstract mathematical approach to signal sampling and reconstruction.  For a more practical approach based on band-limited signals, see Whittaker&#8211;Shannon interpolation formula.
Let F be any sampling method, i.e. a linear map from the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions

In addition to text, images and videos can also be summarized. Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document; image summarization finds the most representative images within an image collection[citation needed]; video summarization extracts the most important frames from the video content.[1]
There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extraction and abstraction. 
Here, content is extracted from the original data, but the extracted content is not modified in any way. Examples of extracted content include key-phrases that can be used to "tag" or index a text document, or key sentences (including headings) that collectively comprise an abstract, and representative images or video segments, as stated above. For text, extraction is analogous to the process of skimming, where the summary (if available), headings and subheadings, figures, the first and last paragraphs of a section, and optionally the first and last sentences in a paragraph are read before one chooses to read the entire document in detail.[2]

The first transaction processing system was SABRE, made by IBM for American Airlines, which became operational in 1970.  Designed to process up to 83,000 transactions a day, the system ran on two IBM 7090 computers.  SABRE was migrated to IBM System/360 computers in 1972, and became an IBM product first as Airline control Program (ACP) and later as Transaction Processing Facility (TPF).  In addition to airlines TPF is used by large banks, credit card companies, and hotel chains.
The Hewlett-Packard NonStop system (formerly Tandem NonStop) was a hardware and software system designed for Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) introduced in 1976.  The systems were designed for transaction processing and provided an extreme level of availability and data integrity.
Transaction processing is distinct from and can be contrasted with other computer processing models, such as batch processing, time-sharing, and real-time processing.[9]

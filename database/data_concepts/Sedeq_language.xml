<doc><id>Sedeq_language</id><concept_name>Sedeq language</concept_name><wiki>Seediq (pronounced [se&#712;ed&#618;q]) is an Atayalic language spoken in the mountains of Northern Taiwan by the Seediq and Taroko people.
Seediq consists of three main dialects (Tsukida 2005). Members of each dialect group refer to themselves by the name of their dialect, while the Amis people call them "Taroko."
In Seediq there are 19 consonant phonemes and 4 vowel phonemes. Among these, there are two velar fricatives, one voiceless and the other voiced, and a uvular stop. In both labial and alveolar plosive series, voice opposition is contrastive; velar and uvular series, however, only display voiceless sounds. The alveolar affricate has a marginal phonological status and is found in some interjections (such as te&#700;cu! "what a mess!"), loanwords and non-finite verbal forms with the gerund prefix cese- (Tsukida 2005: 292, 297).
With the graphemes c and j the practical orthography indicates the palatal allophones of t and d respectively after i and y.

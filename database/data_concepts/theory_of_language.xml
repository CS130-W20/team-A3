<doc><id>theory_of_language</id><concept_name>theory of language</concept_name><wiki>Theory of language or linguistic theory has the goal of answering the question &#8220;What is language?&#8221;[1][2] It is a central issue in theoretical linguistics and philosophy of language. While much of the research in the various fields of linguistics is descriptive, there exists an underlying assumption that  terminological and methodological choices reflect the researcher's understanding of what language is in theoretical terms. Linguists are divided into different schools of thinking, with the nature&#8211;nurture debate as the main divide.[3] Some linguistics conferences and journals are focused on a favoured theory of language, while others remain neutral.[4]
Like in other human and social sciences, theories in linguistics can be divided into humanistic and sociobiological approaches.[5] Same terminology, including rationalism, functionalism, formalism and constructionism, is sometimes used with a different reference in humanist and sociobiological contexts. 
Humanistic theories consider people as agentive in the construction of language. Language is primarily seen as a socio-cultural reality. This tradition emphasises culture, nurture and diversity.[3]
A rationalist approach to language stems from the philosophy Age of Enlightenment. Antoine Arnauld believed that people created language in a step-by-step process by people to serve their psychological needs.[6] During the 19th century, when sociological questions remained under psychology,[7] languages and language change were considered as arising from human psychology and unconscious mind by Heymann Steinthal, Hermann Paul and William Dwight Whitney. Esa Itkonen is a defender of rational explanation of language.[8]

<doc><id>metalanguage</id><concept_name>metalanguage</concept_name><wiki>In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to describe another language, often called the object language.[1] Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in the object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line.[citation needed] The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax.[2]
There are a variety of recognized metalanguages, including embedded, ordered, and nested (or hierarchical) metalanguages.
An embedded metalanguage is a language formally, naturally and firmly fixed in an object language. This idea is found in Douglas Hofstadter's book, G&#246;del, Escher, Bach, in a discussion of the relationship between formal languages and number theory: "... it is in the nature of any formalization of number theory that its metalanguage is embedded within it."[3]
It occurs in natural, or informal, languages, as well&#8212;such as in English, where words such as noun, verb, or even word describe features and concepts pertaining to the English language itself.

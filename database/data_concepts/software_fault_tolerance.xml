Fault-tolerant software has the ability to satisfy requirements despite failures.[1][2]
The only thing constant is change. This is certainly more true of software systems than almost any phenomenon,[3] not all software change in the same way so software fault tolerance methods are designed to overcome execution errors by modifying variable values to create an acceptable program state.[4] The need to control software fault is one of the most rising challenges facing software industries today. Fault tolerance must be a key consideration in the early stage of software development.
There exist different mechanisms for software fault tolerance, among which:
Computer applications make a call using the application programming interface (API) to access shared resources, like the keyboard, mouse, screen, disk drive, network, and printer. These can fail in two ways.

Generation X (or Gen X for short) is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding the Millennials. Researchers and popular media typically use birth years around 1965 to 1980 to define Generation Xers, although some sources use birth years beginning as early as 1960 and ending somewhere from 1977 to 1984.
As children in the 1970s and 1980s, Gen Xers[1] were sometimes called the "latchkey generation", due to reduced adult supervision compared to previous generations, a result of increasing divorce rates and increased maternal participation in the workforce, prior to widespread availability of childcare options outside the home. As adolescents and young adults in the 1980s and 1990s, they were dubbed the "MTV Generation" (a reference to the music video channel), sometimes being characterized as slackers, cynical and disaffected. Some of the cultural influences on Gen X youth were the musical genres of grunge and hip hop music, and independent films. In midlife, research describes them as active, happy, and achieving a work&#8211;life balance. The cohort has been credited with entrepreneurial tendencies, and was the last generation for whom higher education was broadly financially remunerative. Gen Xers are often the parents of Generation Z.

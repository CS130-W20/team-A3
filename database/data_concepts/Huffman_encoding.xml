In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding, an algorithm developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".[1]
The output from Huffman's algorithm can be viewed as a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file).  The algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.  As in other entropy encoding methods, more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols.  Huffman's method can be efficiently implemented, finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted.[2]  However, although optimal among methods encoding symbols separately, Huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods - it is replaced with arithmetic coding or asymmetric numeral systems if better compression ratio is required.
In 1951, David A. Huffman and his MIT information theory classmates were given the choice of a term paper or a final exam. The professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned a term paper on the problem of finding the most efficient binary code. Huffman, unable to prove any codes were the most efficient, was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequency-sorted binary tree and quickly proved this method the most efficient.[3]

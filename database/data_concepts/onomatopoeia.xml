Onomatopoeia (/&#716;&#594;n&#601;&#716;m&#230;t&#601;&#712;pi&#720;&#601;, -&#716;m&#593;&#720;t-/ (listen);[1][2] from the Greek &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#943;&#945;;[3] &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945; for "name"[4] and &#960;&#959;&#953;&#941;&#969; for "I make",[5] adjectival form: "onomatopoeic" or "onomatopoetic"; also onomatop&#339;ia) is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. Such words are themselves also called onomatopoeias. Common onomatopoeias include animal noises such as "oink", "meow" (or "miaow"), "roar" and "chirp". Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system;[6][7] hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as "tick tock" in English, "tic tac" in Spanish and Italian (shown in the picture), "d&#299; d&#257;" in Mandarin, "katchin katchin" in Japanese, or "tik-tik" in Hindi.
Although in the English language the term onomatopoeia means 'the imitation of a sound', the compound word onomatopoeia (&#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#943;&#945;) in the Greek language means 'making or creating names'. For words that imitate sounds, the term &#8052;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972; (echomimetico) or echomimetic) is used. The word &#8052;&#967;&#959;&#956;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972; (echomimetico) derives from "&#8052;&#967;&#974;", meaning 'echo' or 'sound', and "&#956;&#953;&#956;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;", meaning 'mimetic' or 'imitating'.
In the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek brekekekex koax koax (only in Aristophanes' comic play The Frogs) probably for marsh frogs; English ribbit for species of frog found in North America; English verb croak for the common frog.[8]

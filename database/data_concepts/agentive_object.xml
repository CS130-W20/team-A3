<doc><id>agentive_object</id><concept_name>agentive object</concept_name><wiki>In linguistics, a grammatical agent is the thematic relation of the cause or initiator to an event.[1] The agent is a semantic concept distinct from the subject of a sentence as well as from the topic. Whereas the subject is determined syntactically, primarily through word order, the agent is determined through its relationship to the action expressed by the verb. For example, in the sentence "The little girl was bitten by the dog", "girl" is the subject, but "dog" is the agent.
The word "agent" comes from the present participle agens, agentis ("the one doing") of the Latin verb agere, to "do" or "make".
Typically, the situation is denoted by a sentence, the action by a verb in the sentence, and the agent by a noun phrase.
For example, in the sentence "Jack kicked the ball", Jack is the agent and "the ball" is the patient. In certain languages, the agent is declined or otherwise marked to indicate its grammatical role. Modern English does not mark the agentive grammatical role of a noun in a sentence. Although certain nouns do have a permanent trait of agency (agent noun: runner, kicker, etc.), an agent noun is not necessarily an agent of a sentence: "Jack kicked the runner".

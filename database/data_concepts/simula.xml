<doc><id>simula</id><concept_name>simula</concept_name><wiki>Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, Simula I and Simula 67, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard. Syntactically, it is a fairly faithful superset of ALGOL 60,[1]:1.3.1 also influenced by the design of Simscript.[2]
Simula 67 introduced objects,[1]:2, 5.3 classes,[1]:1.3.3, 2 inheritance and subclasses,[1]:2.2.1 virtual procedures,[1]:2.2.3 coroutines,[1]:9.2 and discrete event simulation,[1]:14.2 and features garbage collection.[1]:9.1 Also other forms of subtyping (besides inheriting subclasses) were introduced in Simula derivatives.[citation needed]
Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. As its name suggests, Simula was designed for doing simulations, and the needs of that domain provided the framework for many of the features of object-oriented languages today.
Simula has been used in a wide range of applications such as simulating VLSI designs, process modeling, protocols, algorithms, and other applications such as typesetting, computer graphics, and education. The influence of Simula is often understated, and Simula-type objects are reimplemented in C++, Object Pascal, Java, C# and several other languages. Computer scientists such as Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, and James Gosling, creator of Java, have acknowledged Simula as a major influence.[3]

<doc><id>user_requirements</id><concept_name>user requirements</concept_name><wiki>The user requirement(s) document (URD) or user requirement(s) specification (URS) is a document usually used in software engineering that specifies what the user expects the software to be able to do.
Once the required information is completely gathered it is documented in a URD, which is meant to spell out exactly what the software must do and becomes part of the contractual agreement.  A customer cannot demand features not in the URD, while the developer cannot claim the product is ready if it does not meet an item of the URD.
The URD can be used as a guide to planning cost, timetables, milestones, testing, etc.  The explicit nature of the URD allows customers to show it to various stakeholders to make sure all necessary features are described.
Formulating a URD requires negotiation  to determine what is technically and economically feasible.  Preparing a URD is one of those skills that lies between a science and an art, requiring both software technical skills and interpersonal skills.[1]

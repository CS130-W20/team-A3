Sets A and B of natural numbers are said to be recursively isomorphic if there is a total computable bijection f from the set of natural numbers to itself such that f(A) = B. 
A set A of natural numbers is said to be one-one reducible to a set B if there is a total computable injection f on the natural numbers such that 



f
(
A
)
&#8838;
B


{\displaystyle f(A)\subseteq B}

 and 



f
(

N

&#8726;
A
)
&#8838;

N

&#8726;
B


{\displaystyle f(\mathbb {N} \setminus A)\subseteq \mathbb {N} \setminus B}

.
Myhill's isomorphism theorem states that two sets A and B of natural numbers are recursively isomorphic if and only if A is one-reducible to B and B is one-reducible to A.

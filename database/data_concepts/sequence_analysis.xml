<doc><id>sequence_analysis</id><concept_name>sequence analysis</concept_name><wiki>In bioinformatics, sequence analysis is the process of subjecting a DNA, RNA or peptide sequence to any of a wide range of analytical methods to understand its features, function, structure, or evolution. Methodologies used include sequence alignment, searches against biological databases, and others.[1] Since the development of methods of high-throughput production of gene and protein sequences, the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increased exponentially. Such a collection of sequences does not, by itself, increase the scientist's understanding of the biology of organisms. However, comparing these new sequences to those with known functions is a key way of understanding the biology of an organism from which the new sequence comes. Thus, sequence analysis can be used to assign function to genes and proteins by the study of the similarities between the compared sequences. Nowadays, there are many tools and techniques that provide the sequence comparisons (sequence alignment) and analyze the alignment product to understand its biology.
Sequence analysis in molecular biology includes a very wide range of relevant topics:
In chemistry, sequence analysis comprises techniques used to determine the sequence of a polymer formed of several monomers.
In molecular biology and genetics, the same process is called simply "sequencing".
In marketing, sequence analysis is often used in analytical customer relationship management applications, such as NPTB models (Next Product to Buy).

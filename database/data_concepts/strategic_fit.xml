The matching takes place through strategy and it is therefore vital that the company has the actual resources and capabilities to execute and support the strategy. Strategic fit can be used actively to evaluate the current strategic situation of a company as well as opportunities such as M&amp;A and divestitures of organizational divisions. Strategic fit is related to the Resource-based view of the firm which suggests that the key to profitability is not only through positioning and industry selection but rather through an internal focus which seeks to utilize the unique characteristics of the company&#8217;s portfolio of resources and capabilities.[1] A unique combination of resources and capabilities can eventually be developed into a competitive advantage which the company can profit from.

Resources relate to the inputs to production owned by the company, whereas capabilities describe the accumulation of learning the company possesses. 
Resources can be classified both as tangible and intangible:

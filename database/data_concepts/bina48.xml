<doc><id>bina48</id><concept_name>bina48</concept_name><wiki>BINA48 (Breakthrough Intelligence via Neural Architecture 48*)[1] is a robotic face combined with the chatbot functionalities, enabling simple conversation facilities similar to chatbots. BINA48 is owned by Martine Rothblatt's Terasem Movement,[2] and its bust-like head was modeled after Rothblatt's wife and shoulders mounted on a frame, developed by Hanson Robotics and released in 2010.
In 2007, Martine Rothblatt was approached by roboticist David Hanson, and Rothblatt commissioned Hanson Robotics to create a robot using her wife, Bina Aspen Rothblatt, as the template.[3] Hanson created BINA48 in his Plano, Texas laboratory. The robot is currently housed in Vermont, at the offices of the Terasem Movement Foundation (TMF), and curated by TMF's executive director, Bruce Duncan.
BINA48 connects to the Internet and has thirty-two facial motors under a skin of rubber. Though without a complete body, the head-and-shoulder robotics express sixty-four different facial gestures. It employs a mix off-the-shelf software and customized artificial intelligence algorithms, using a microphone to hear, voice recognition software, dictation software which allows improvement in ability to listen and retain information during a conversation, sees the world through two video cameras, and has facial recognition software to remember frequent visitors.
In 2014, a project called Conversations with Bina48 was started by artist Stephanie Dinkins. The project has explored how an algorithm oriented world would affect various minority groups.[4]

The SI derived unit is: kilogram per square metre (kg&#183;m&#8722;2). In the paper and fabric industries, it is called grammage and is expressed in grams per square meter (gsm); for paper in particular, it may be expressed as pounds per ream of standard sizes ("basis ream").
Area density can be calculated as:

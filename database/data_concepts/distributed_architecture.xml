A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another.[1] The components interact with one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock, and independent failure of components.[1] Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.
A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called  a distributed program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such programs).[2] There are many different types of implementations for the message passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message queues.[3]
Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers,[4] which communicate with each other via message passing.[5]
The word distributed in terms such as "distributed system", "distributed programming", and "distributed algorithm" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area.[6] The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.[5]

Various national and local transportation agencies, academic institutions and consulting firms use simulation to aid in their management of transportation networks.
Simulation in transportation is important because it can study models too complicated for analytical or numerical treatment, can be used for experimental studies, can study detailed relations that might be lost in analytical or numerical treatment and can produce attractive visual demonstrations of present and future scenarios.
To understand simulation, it is important to understand the concept of system state, which is a set of variables that contains enough information to describe the evolution of the system over time.[3] System state can be either discrete or continuous. Traffic simulation models are classified according to discrete and continuous time, state, and space.[4]
Simulation methods in transportation can employ a selection of theories, including probability and statistics, differential equations and numerical methods.

Generally, one buys a call option on the bond if one believes that interest rates will fall, causing an increase in bond prices. Likewise, one buys the put option if one believes that the opposite will be the case.[1] One result of trading in a bond option, is that the price of the underlying bond is "locked in" for the term of the contract, thereby reducing the credit risk associated with fluctuations in the bond price.
Bonds, the underlyers in this case,  exhibit what is known as pull-to-par: as the bond reaches its maturity date, all of the prices involved with the bond become known, thereby decreasing its volatility. On the other hand, the Black&#8211;Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, does not reflect this process, and cannot therefore be applied here; [1] see Black&#8211;Scholes model #Valuing bond options.
Addressing this, bond options are usually valued using the Black model or with a lattice-based short rate model such as Black-Derman-Toy, Ho-Lee or Hull&#8211;White. [2] The latter approach is theoretically more correct, [3], although in practice the Black Model is more widely used for reasons of simplicity and speed. For American- and Bermudan- styled options, where exercise is permitted prior to maturity, only the lattice-based approach is applicable.

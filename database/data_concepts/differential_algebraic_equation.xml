Such systems occur as the general form of (systems of) differential equations for vector&#8211;valued functions x in one independent variable t,
where 



x

{\displaystyle x:[a,b]\to \mathbb {R} ^{n}}

 is a vector of dependent variables

They are distinct from ordinary differential equation (ODE) in that a DAE is not completely solvable for the derivatives of all components of the function x because these may not all appear (i.e. some equations are algebraic); technically the distinction between an implicit ODE system [that may be rendered explicit] and a DAE system is that the Jacobian matrix

)


&#8706;

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial F(u,v,t)}{\partial u}}}

 is a singular matrix for a DAE system.[1] This distinction between ODEs and DAEs is made because DAEs have different characteristics and are generally more difficult to solve.[2]
In practical terms, the distinction between DAEs and ODEs is often that the solution of a DAE system depends on the derivatives of the input signal and not just the signal itself as in the case of ODEs;[3] this issue is commonly encountered in systems with hysteresis,[4] such as the Schmitt trigger.[5]
This difference is more clearly visible if the system may be rewritten so that instead of x we consider a pair

x
,
y
)


{\displaystyle (x,y)}

 of vectors of dependent variables and the DAE has the form

A pitch-accent language is a language that has word-accents&#8212;that is, where one syllable in a word or morpheme is more prominent than the others, but the accentuated syllable is indicated by a particular pitch contour (linguistic tones) rather than by stress. This contrasts with fully tonal languages like Standard Chinese, in which each syllable can have an independent tone.
Languages that have been described as pitch-accent languages include most dialects of Serbo-Croatian, Macedonian, Slovene, Baltic languages, Ancient Greek, Vedic Sanskrit, Turkish, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Western Basque,[1] Yaqui,[2] certain dialects of Korean, and Shanghainese.[3]
Pitch-accent languages tend to fall into two categories: those with a single pitch-contour (for example, high, or high&#8211;low) on the accented syllable, such as Tokyo Japanese, Western Basque, or Persian; and those in which more than one pitch-contour can occur on the accented syllable, such as Punjabi, Swedish, or Serbo-Croatian. In this latter kind, the accented syllable is also often stressed.

FJA produces standardized occupational information specific to the performance of the work and the performer.[1]
Quantitative approach to job analysis that utilizes a compiled inventory of the various functions or work activities that can make up any job and that assumes that each job involves three broad worker functions: 1) data 2) people 3) things.
The most recent version of FJA uses seven scales to describe what workers do in jobs: (1) Things, (2) Data, (3) People, 
(4) Worker Instructions, (5) Reasoning, (6) Math, and (7) Language.[2]

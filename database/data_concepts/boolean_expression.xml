<doc><id>boolean_expression</id><concept_name>boolean expression</concept_name><wiki>In computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression used in programming languages that produces a Boolean value when evaluated. A Boolean value is either true or false. A Boolean expression may be composed of a combination of the Boolean constants true or false, Boolean-typed variables, Boolean-valued operators, and Boolean-valued functions.[1]
Boolean expressions correspond to propositional formulas in logic and are a special case of Boolean circuits.[2]
Most programming languages have the Boolean operators OR, AND and NOT; in C and some newer languages, these are represented by "||" (double pipe character), "&amp;&amp;" (double ampersand) and "!" (exclamation point) respectively, while the corresponding bitwise operations are represented by "|", "&amp;" and "~" (tilde).[3]  In the mathematical literature the symbols used are often "+" (plus), "&#183;" (dot) and overbar, or "&#8744;" (cup), "&#8743;" (cap) and "&#172;" or "&#8242;" (prime).

<doc><id>Pumi_language</id><concept_name>Pumi language</concept_name><wiki>The Pumi language (also known as Prinmi[citation needed]) is a Qiangic language used by the Pumi people, an ethnic group from Yunnan, China, as well as by the Tibetan people of Muli in Sichuan, China.[3][4] Most native speakers live in Lanping, Ninglang, Lijiang, Weixi and Muli.
The autonym of the Pumi is p&#688;&#656;&#601;&#771;&#741;mi&#741; in Western Prinmi, p&#688;&#633;&#297;&#741;mi&#741; in Central Prinmi, and p&#688;&#656;&#245;&#741;m&#601;&#741;&#743; in Northern Prinmi with variants such as p&#688;&#633;&#601;&#771;&#741;m&#601;&#741; and t&#642;&#688;&#601;&#771;&#741;mi&#741;&#743;.[5][6]
In Muli Bonist priests read religious texts in Tibetan, which needs to be interpreted into Prinmi.[citation needed] An attempt to teach Pumi children to write their language using the Tibetan script has been seen in Ninglang.[7] A pinyin-based Roman script has been proposed, but is not commonly used.[8]
Earlier works suggest there are two branches of Pumi (southern and northern), and they are not mutually intelligible. Ding (2014) proposes three major groups: Western Prinmi (spoken in Lanping), Central Prinmi (spoken in southwestern Ninglang, Lijiang, Yulong and Yongsheng) and Northern Prinmi (spoken in northern Ninglang and Sichuan).[9]

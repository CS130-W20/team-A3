<doc><id>voiceless_consonant</id><concept_name>voiceless consonant</concept_name><wiki>In linguistics, voicelessness is the property of sounds being pronounced without the larynx vibrating. Phonologically, it is a type of phonation, which contrasts with other states of the larynx, but some object that the word phonation implies voicing and that voicelessness is the lack of phonation.
The International Phonetic Alphabet has distinct letters for many voiceless and modally voiced pairs of consonants (the obstruents), such as [p b], [t d], [k &#609;], [q &#610;], [f v], and [s z]. Also, there are diacritics for voicelessness,  .mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}U+0325 &#8194;&#805; .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller{font-size:85%}COMBINING RING BELOW and U+030A &#8194;&#778; COMBINING RING ABOVE, which is used for letters with a descender. Diacritics are typically used with letters for prototypically voiced sounds, such as vowels and sonorant consonants: [&#7681;], [l&#805;], [&#331;&#778;].
Sonorants are sounds such as vowels and nasals that are voiced in most of the world's languages. However, in some languages sonorants may be voiceless, usually allophonically. For example, the Japanese word sukiyaki is pronounced [su&#805;kijaki] and may sound like [skijaki] to an English speaker, but the lips can be seen to compress for the [u&#805;]. Something similar happens in English words like peculiar [p&#688;&#601;&#805;&#712;kj&#778;u&#720;li&#602;] and potato [p&#688;&#601;&#805;&#712;t&#688;e&#618;to&#650;].
Voiceless vowels are also an areal feature in languages of the American Southwest (like Hopi and Keres), the Great Basin (including all Numic languages), and the Great Plains, where they are present in Numic Comanche but also in Algonquian Cheyenne, and the Caddoan language Arikara.

Target recognition was initially done by using an audible representation of the received signal, where a trained operator who would decipher that sound to classify the target illuminated by the radar.  While these trained operators had success, automated methods have been developed and continue to be developed that allow for more accuracy and speed in classification.  ATR can be used to identify man made objects such as ground and air vehicles as well as for biological targets such as animals, humans, and vegetative clutter. This can be useful for everything from recognizing an object on a battlefield to filtering out interference caused by large flocks of birds on Doppler weather radar.
Possible military applications include a simple identification system such as an IFF transponder, and is used in other applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. There has been more and more interest shown in using ATR for domestic applications as well.  Research has been done into using ATR for border security, safety systems to identify objects or people on a subway track, automated vehicles, and many others.
Target recognition has existed almost as long as radar.  Radar operators would identify enemy bombers and fighters through the audio representation that was received by the reflected signal (see Radar in World War II).

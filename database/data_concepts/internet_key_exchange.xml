IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol and ISAKMP.[1] IKE uses X.509 certificates for authentication &#8210; either pre-shared or distributed using DNS (preferably with DNSSEC) &#8210; and a Diffie&#8211;Hellman key exchange to set up a shared session secret from which cryptographic keys are derived.[2][3] In addition, a security policy for every peer which will connect must be manually maintained.[2]
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) originally defined IKE in November 1998 in a series of publications (Request for Comments) known as RFC 2407, RFC 2408 and RFC 2409:
RFC 4306 updated IKE to version two (IKEv2) in December 2005.[7] RFC 4718 clarified some open details in October 2006.[8] RFC 5996 combined these two documents plus additional clarifications into the updated IKEv2,[9] published in September 2010. A later update upgraded the document from Proposed Standard to Internet Standard,  published as RFC 7296 in October 2014.
The parent organization of the IETF, The Internet Society (ISOC), has maintained the copyrights of these standards as freely available to the Internet community.

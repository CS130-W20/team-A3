In pseudocode the algorithm can be stated as:
Note that the number of objective function evaluations per loop is one evaluation per firefly, even though the above pseudocode suggests it is n&#215;n. (Based on Yang's MATLAB code.) Thus the total number of objective function evaluations is (number of generations) &#215; (number of fireflies).
The main update formula for any pair of two fireflies

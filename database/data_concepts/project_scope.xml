<doc><id>project_scope</id><concept_name>project scope</concept_name><wiki>In project management, scope is the defined features and functions of a product, or the scope of work needed to finish a project. Scope involves getting information required to start a project, and the features the product would have that would meet its stakeholders requirements.[1]
Project scope is oriented towards the work required and methods needed, while Product Scope is more oriented toward functional requirements. If requirements aren't completely defined and described and if there is no effective change control in a project, scope or requirement creep may ensue.
Scope management is the listing of the items to be produced or tasks to be done to the required quantity, quality and variety, in the time and with the resources available and agreed upon, and the modification of those variable constraints by dynamic flexible juggling in the event of changed circumstance called as Scope creep.

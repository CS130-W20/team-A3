<doc><id>software_feature</id><concept_name>software feature</concept_name><wiki>In software, a feature has several definitions.[1] The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers defines the term feature in IEEE 829 as "A distinguishing characteristic of a software item (e.g., performance, portability, or functionality)." [2]
A piece of software is said to be feature-rich when it has many options and functional capabilities available to the user. Progressive disclosure is a technique applied to reduce the potential confusion caused by displaying a wealth of features at once.
Sometimes if a piece of software is very feature-rich, that can be seen as a bad thing - see feature creep and software bloat.

The function to be interpolated is known at given points 



(

x

i


,

y

i


,

z

i

)


{\displaystyle (x_{i},y_{i},z_{i},\dots )}

 and the interpolation problem consist of yielding values at arbitrary points 



(
x

y
,
z

&#8230;
)


{\displaystyle (x,y,z,\dots )}

.
Multivariate interpolation is particularly important in geostatistics, where it is used to create a digital elevation model from a set of points on the Earth's surface (for example, spot heights in a topographic survey or depths in a hydrographic survey).
For function values known on a regular grid (having predetermined, not necessarily uniform, spacing), the following methods are available.

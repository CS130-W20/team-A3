Control limits should not be confused with tolerance limits or specifications, which are completely independent of the distribution of the plotted sample statistic. Control limits describe what a process is capable of producing (sometimes referred to as the &#8220;voice of the process&#8221;), while tolerances and specifications describe how the product should perform to meet the customer's expectations (referred to as the &#8220;voice of the customer&#8221;).
Control limits are used to detect signals in process data that indicate that a process is not in control and, therefore, not operating predictably. 
There are several sets of rules for detecting signals - see Control chart - in one specification:

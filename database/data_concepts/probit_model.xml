The word is a portmanteau, coming from probability + unit.[1] The purpose of the model is to estimate the probability that an observation with particular characteristics will fall into a specific one of the categories; moreover, classifying observations based on their predicted probabilities is a type of binary classification model.
A probit model is a popular specification for a binary response model. As such it treats the same set of problems as does logistic regression using similar techniques. When viewed in the generalized linear model framework, the probit model employs a probit link function.[2] It is most often estimated using the maximum likelihood procedure,[3] such an estimation being called a probit regression.
Suppose a response variable Y is binary, that is it can have only two possible outcomes which we will denote as 1 and 0. For example, Y may represent presence/absence of a certain condition, success/failure of some device, answer yes/no on a survey, etc. We also have a vector of regressors X, which are assumed to influence the outcome Y. Specifically, we assume that the model takes the form
where Pr denotes probability, and &#934; is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. The parameters &#946; are typically estimated by maximum likelihood.

This is a list of file formats used by computers, organized by type. Filename extensions are usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the file format name or abbreviation. Many operating systems do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system.  Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include Unix-like systems, and Microsoft Windows NT, 95, 98, and ME which have no three character limit on extensions for 32-bit or 64-bit applications on file systems other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system.  Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters.  While MS-DOS and NT always see the final period in a filename as an extension, in UNIX-like systems, the final period doesn't necessarily mean the text afterward is the extension.[1]
Some file formats, such as .txt or .text, may be listed multiple times.

<doc><id>loan_word</id><concept_name>loan word</concept_name><wiki>A loanword (also loan word or loan-word) is a word adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without translation. This is in contrast to cognates, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an etymological origin, and calques, which involve translation.
A loanword is distinguished from a calque (or loan translation), which is a word or phrase whose meaning or idiom is adopted from another language by word-for-word translation into existing words or word-forming roots of the recipient language.[1]
Examples of loanwords in the English language include caf&#233; (from French caf&#233;, which literally means "coffee"), bazaar (from Persian b&#257;z&#257;r, which means "market"), and kindergarten (from German Kindergarten, which literally means  "children's garden").
In a bit of involutionally heterological irony, the word calque is a loanword from the French noun calque ("tracing; imitation; close copy");[2] while the word loanword and the phrase loan translation are calques of the German nouns Lehnwort[3] and Lehn&#252;bersetzung.[4]

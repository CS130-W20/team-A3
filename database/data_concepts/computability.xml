It is a key topic of the field of computability theory within mathematical logic and the theory of computation within computer science. The computability of a problem is closely linked to the existence of an algorithm to solve the problem.
The most widely studied models of computability are the Turing-computable and &#956;-recursive functions, and the lambda calculus, all of which have computationally equivalent power. Other forms of computability are studied as well: computability notions weaker than Turing machines are studied in automata theory, while computability notions stronger than Turing machines are studied in the field of hypercomputation.
A central idea in computability is that of a (computational) problem, which is a task whose computability can be explored.
There are two key types of problems:

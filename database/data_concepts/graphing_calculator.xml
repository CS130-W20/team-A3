Most popular graphing calculators are also programmable and therefore considered to be programmable calculators, allowing the user to create customized programs, typically for scientific, engineering and education applications. Because they have large displays in comparison to standard 4-operation handheld calculators, graphing calculators also typically display several lines of text and calculations at the same time.
An early "graphical calculator" was designed and patented by electrical engineer, Edith Clarke, in 1925.[1] The calculator was used to solve problems with electrical power line transmission.[2]
Casio produced the first commercially available graphing calculator, the fx-7000G, in 1985. Casio's innovations include an icon menu for easy access to functions (1994, FX-7700GE and later), graphing in several colors (1995, CFX-9800G), textbook-like "Natural Display" input and output (2004, FX-82ES/300ES &amp; FX-9860G), expandable memory (2005, FX-9860SD), backlit screen (2006, FX-9860G Slim), full-color, high resolution backlit screen (2010, FX-CG10/CG20 PRIZM).
Sharp produced its first graphing calculator, the EL-5200, in 1986. Since then Sharp's innovations include models with a touchscreen (EL9600 series), Equation Editor[3] (textbook-like input) (EL-9300[4] ( 1992[5] ) and later), and reversible keyboard[6] to ease learning (one side has basic functions, the other side has additional functions) (March 2005, EL-9900[7]).

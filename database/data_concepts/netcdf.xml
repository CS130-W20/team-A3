<doc><id>netcdf</id><concept_name>netcdf</concept_name><wiki>NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. The project homepage[1] is hosted by the Unidata program at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). They are also the chief source of netCDF software, standards development, updates, etc. The format is an open standard. NetCDF Classic and 64-bit Offset Format are an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium.[2]
The project started in 1989 and is still actively supported by UCAR. The original netCDF binary format (released in 1997, now known as "netCDF classic format") is still widely used across the world and continues to be fully supported in all netCDF releases. Version 4.0 (released in 2008) allowed the use of the HDF5 data file format. Version 4.1 (2010) added support for C and Fortran client access to specified subsets of remote data via OPeNDAP. Version 4.3.0 (2012) added a CMake build system for Windows builds. Version 4.7.0 (2019) added support for reading Amazon S3 objects. Further releases are planned to improve performance, add features, and fix bugs. 
The format was originally based on the conceptual model of the Common Data Format developed by NASA, but has since diverged and is not compatible with it.[3][4]
The netCDF libraries support multiple different binary formats for netCDF files:

When this technique is used with a large number of closely related species, this is called phylogenetic shadowing.[1]
Researchers have found that non-coding pieces of DNA contain binding sites for regulatory proteins that govern the spatiotemporal expression of genes.  These transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), or regulatory motifs, have proven hard to identify, primarily because they are short in length, and can show sequence variation. The importance of understanding transcriptional regulation to many fields of biology has led researchers to develop strategies for predicting the presence of TFBS, many of which have led to publicly available databases. One such technique is  Phylogenetic Footprinting.
Phylogenetic footprinting relies upon two major concepts:
Phylogenetic footprinting was first used and published by Tagle et al. in 1988, which allowed researchers to predict evolutionary conserved cis-regulatory elements responsible for embryonic &#949; and &#947; globulin gene expression in primates.[3]

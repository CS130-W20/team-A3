A library catalog (or library catalogue in British English) is a register of all bibliographic items found in a library or group of libraries, such as a network of libraries at several locations. A bibliographic item can be any information entity (e.g., books, computer files, graphics, realia, cartographic materials, etc.) that is considered library material (e.g., a single novel in an anthology), or a group of library materials (e.g., a trilogy), or linked from the catalog (e.g., a webpage) as far as it is relevant to the catalog and to the users (patrons) of the library.
The card catalog was a familiar sight to library users for generations, but it has been effectively replaced by the online public access catalog (OPAC). Some still refer to the online catalog as a "card catalog".[who?]  Some libraries with OPAC access still have card catalogs on site, but these are now strictly a secondary resource and are seldom updated.  Many libraries that retain their physical card catalog will post a sign advising the last year that the card catalog was updated.  Some libraries have eliminated their  card catalog in favour of the OPAC for the purpose of saving space for other use, such as additional shelving.
The largest library catalog in the world[citation needed] is the WorldCat.org union catalog managed by the non-profit library cooperative OCLC, based in Dublin, Ohio.  In January 2016, WorldCat.org had over 360,000,000 catalog records and over 2 billion library holdings.[1]

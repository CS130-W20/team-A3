<doc><id>Chinese_speech_synthesis</id><concept_name>Chinese speech synthesis</concept_name><wiki>Chinese speech synthesis is the application of speech synthesis to the Chinese language (usually Standard Chinese).  It poses additional difficulties due to the Chinese characters (which frequently have different pronunciations in different contexts), the complex prosody, which is essential to convey the meaning of words, and sometimes the difficulty in obtaining agreement among native speakers concerning what the correct pronunciation is of certain phonemes.
Recordings can be concatenated in any desired combination, but the joins sound forced (as is usual for simple concatenation-based speech synthesis) and this can severely affect prosody; these synthesizers are also inflexible in terms of speed and expression. However, because these synthesizers do not rely on a corpus, there is no noticeable degradation in performance when they are given more unusual or awkward phrases.
Ekho is an open source TTS which simply concatenates sampled syllables. It currently supports Cantonese, Mandarin, and experimentally Korean.  Some of the Mandarin syllables have been pitched-normalised in Praat.  A modified version of these is used in Gradint's "synthesis from partials".
cjkware.com used to ship a product called KeyTip Putonghua Reader which worked similarly; it contained 120 Megabytes of sound recordings (GSM-compressed to 40 Megabytes in the evaluation version), comprising 10,000 multi-syllable dictionary words plus single-syllable recordings in 6 different prosodies (4 tones, neutral tone, and an extra third-tone recording for use at the end of a phrase).

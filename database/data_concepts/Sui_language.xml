<doc><id>Sui_language</id><concept_name>Sui language</concept_name><wiki>The Sui language (simplified Chinese: &#27700;&#35821;; traditional Chinese: &#27700;&#35486;; pinyin: Shu&#464;y&#468;) is a Kam&#8211;Sui language spoken by the Sui people of Guizhou province in China. According to Ethnologue, it was spoken by around 300,000 people in 2007. Sui is also unique for its rich inventory of consonants, with the Sandong (&#19977;&#27934;) dialect having as many as 70 consonants.[citation needed] The language also has its own script, known as "Shuishu" (&#27700;&#26360;) in Chinese, which is used for ritual purposes.
Some regionally atypical features of the Sui language include voiceless nasals (hm, hn), palatal stops, postvelar stops, prenasalized stops (mb, nd), and pre-glottalized stops and nasals (i.e. &#660;b, &#660;m).
The Sui language is divided into three dialects with minor differences (Wei &amp; Edmondson 2008).[4]
In Guangxi, Sui is spoken by about 7,000 people in Hechi and 1,900 in Nandan County (e.g., in Longmazhuang &#40857;&#39532;&#24196; of Liuzhai Township &#20845;&#23528;&#38215;, with the autonym pu&#742; sui&#743;).[5]

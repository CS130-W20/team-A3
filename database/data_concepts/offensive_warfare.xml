<doc><id>offensive_warfare</id><concept_name>offensive warfare</concept_name><wiki>An offensive is a military operation that seeks through an aggressive projection of armed forces to occupy territory, gain an objective or achieve some larger strategic, operational, or tactical goal. Another term for an offensive often used by the media is 'invasion', or the more general 'attack'.
The offensive was considered[when?] a pre-eminent means of producing victory, although with the recognition of a defensive phase at some stage of the execution.[1]
A quick guide to the size or scope of the offensive is to consider the number of troops involved in the side initiating the offensive.
Offensives are largely conducted as a means to secure initiative in a confrontation between opponents. They can be waged on land, at sea[2] or in the air.

<doc><id>information_exchange</id><concept_name>information exchange</concept_name><wiki>Information exchange or information sharing is the act of certain entities (e.g. people) passing information from one to another. This could be done electronically or through certain systems.[1] These are terms that can either refer to bidirectional information transfer in telecommunications and computer science or communication seen from a system-theoretic or information-theoretic point of view. As, "information," in this context invariably refers to (electronic) data that encodes and represents[2] the information at hand, a broader treatment can be found under data exchange.
Information exchange has a long history in information technology.[3] Traditional information sharing referred to one-to-one exchanges of data between a sender and receiver. Online information sharing gives useful data to businesses for future strategies based on online sharing.[4] These information exchanges are implemented via dozens of open and proprietary protocols, message, and file formats. Electronic data interchange (EDI) is a successful implementation of commercial data exchanges that began in the late 1970s and remains in use today.[5]
Some controversy comes when discussing regulations regarding information exchange.[6] Initiatives to standardize information sharing protocols include extensible markup language (XML), simple object access protocol (SOAP), and web services description language (WSDL).
From the point of view of a computer scientist, the four primary information sharing design patterns are sharing information one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and many-to-one. Technologies to meet all four of these design patterns are evolving and include blogs, wikis, really simple syndication, tagging, and chat.

This test, and an estimator for heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, were proposed by Halbert White in 1980.[1] These methods have become extremely widely used, making this paper one of the most cited articles in economics.[2]
In cases where the White test statistic is statistically significant, heteroskedasticity may not necessarily be the cause; instead the problem could be a specification error. In other words, the White test can be a test of heteroskedasticity or specification error or both. If no cross product terms are introduced in the White test procedure, then this is a test of pure heteroskedasticity.
If cross products are introduced in the model, then it is a test of both heteroskedasticity and specification bias.
To test for constant variance one undertakes an auxiliary regression analysis: this regresses the squared residuals from the original regression model onto a set of regressors that contain the original regressors along with their squares and cross-products.[3] One then inspects the R2. The Lagrange multiplier (LM) test statistic is the product of the R2 value and sample size:

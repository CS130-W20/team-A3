Computational mathematics may refer to two different aspects of the relation between computing and mathematics. 
Computational applied mathematics consists roughly of using mathematics for allowing and improving computer computation in applied mathematics. Computational mathematics may also refer to the use of computers for mathematics itself. This includes the use of computers for mathematical computations (computer algebra), the study of what can (and cannot) be computerized in mathematics (effective methods), which computations may be done with present technology (complexity theory), and which proofs can be done on computers (proof assistants).
Both aspects of computational mathematics involves mathematical research in mathematics as well as in areas of science where computing plays a central and essential role&#8212;that, is almost all sciences&#8212;and emphasize algorithms, numerical methods, and symbolic computations.[1]
Computational mathematics emerged as a distinct part of applied mathematics by the early 1950s. Currently, computational mathematics can refer to or include:

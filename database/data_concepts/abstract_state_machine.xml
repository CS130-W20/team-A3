The ASM Method is a practical and scientifically well-founded systems engineering method that bridges the gap between the two ends of system development:
The method builds upon three basic concepts: 
In the original conception of ASMs, a single agent executes a program in a sequence of steps, possibly interacting with its environment. This notion was extended to capture distributed computations, in which multiple agents execute their programs concurrently.

<doc><id>software_distribution</id><concept_name>software distribution</concept_name><wiki>Software distribution can refer to 2 distinct concepts. When used as a verb, software distribution is the process of delivering software to the end user, while a software distribution, as a noun, (distro) is a collection of software.
A software distribution (noun), or distro, is a collection of software components built, assembled and configured so that it can essentially be used "as is". It is often the closest thing to turnkey form of free software. A distro may take the form of a binary distribution, with an executable installer which can be downloaded from the Internet. Examples range from whole operating system distributions to server and interpreter distributions (for example WAMP installers). Software distributions (noun) can also refer to careware and donateware.
In recent years, the term has come to refer to nearly any "finished" software (i.e. something that is more or less ready for its intended use, whether as a complete system or a component of a larger system) that is assembled primarily from open source components.
Examples of software distributions include BSD-based distros (such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and DragonflyBSD) and Linux-based distros such as openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Fedora).

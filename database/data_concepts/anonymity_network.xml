<doc><id>anonymity_network</id><concept_name>anonymity network</concept_name><wiki>In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application or appliance that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from servers that provide those resources.[1] A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially masking the true origin of the request to the resource server.
Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a requested resource, such as a file or web page for example, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request,[2] or provide additional benefits such as load balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems.[3]
A proxy server may reside on the user's local computer, or at any point between the user's computer and destination servers on the Internet. A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called a gateway or sometimes a tunneling proxy. A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources (in most cases anywhere on the Internet). A reverse proxy is usually an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks such as load-balancing, authentication, decryption and caching.
An open proxy is a forwarding proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user. As of 2008, Gordon Lyon estimates that "hundreds of thousands" of open proxies are operated on the Internet.[4]

Class-5 switch services include basic dial-tone, calling features, and additional digital and data services to subscribers connected to a local loop.
The fundamental difference between class 5 and the other classes is that a class-5 switch provides telephone service to customers, and as such is concerned with "subscriber type" activities: generation of dial-tone and other "comfort noises"; handling of network services such as advice of duration and charge etc.  Specifically, a class-5 switch provides dial tone, local switching and access to the rest of the network. Class-4 switches do not provide subscriber lines, their role is to route calls between other switches.
Typically a class-5 switch serves an area of a city, an individual town, or several villages and could serve from several hundred to 100,000 subscribers.
Since the replacement of electromechanical exchanges by modern digital ones, the function of a class-5 switch in rural areas is often performed by a remote switch or Remote Digital Terminal installed at the original switch site to handle local switching or concentration, respectively.  The class-5 switching infrastructure is then physically located in a larger population center.  Urban areas with extensive underground plant tend to keep the classic class-5 office architecture.

<doc><id>topos_theory</id><concept_name>topos theory</concept_name><wiki>In mathematics, a topos (UK: /&#712;t&#594;p&#594;s/, US: /&#712;to&#650;po&#650;s, &#712;to&#650;p&#594;s/; plural topoi /&#712;to&#650;p&#596;&#618;/ or /&#712;t&#594;p&#596;&#618;/, or toposes) is a category that behaves like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space (or more generally: on a site). Topoi behave much like the category of sets and possess a notion of localization; they are a direct generalization of point-set topology.[1]  The Grothendieck topoi find applications in algebraic geometry; the more general elementary topoi are used in logic.
Since the introduction of sheaves into mathematics in the 1940s, a major theme has been to study a space by studying sheaves on a space.  This idea was expounded by Alexander Grothendieck by introducing the notion of a "topos". The main utility of this notion is in the abundance of situations in mathematics where topological heuristics are very effective, but an honest topological space is lacking; it is sometimes possible to find a topos formalizing the heuristic. An important example of this programmatic idea is the &#233;tale topos of a scheme.
Let C be a category. A theorem of Jean Giraud states that the following are equivalent:
A category with these properties is called a "(Grothendieck) topos".  Here Presh(D) denotes the category of contravariant functors from D to the category of sets; such a contravariant functor is frequently called a presheaf.

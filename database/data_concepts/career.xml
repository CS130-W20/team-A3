The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word "career" as a person's "course or progress through life (or a distinct portion of life)". This definition relates "career" to a range of aspects of an individual's life, learning, and work. "Career" is also frequently understood[by whom?] to relate to the working aspects of an individual's life - as in "career woman", for example. A third way in which the term "career" is used describes an occupation or a profession that usually involves special training or formal education,;[1] considered[by whom?] to be a person's lifework.[2][failed verification] In this case "a career" is seen[by whom?] as a sequence of related jobs, usually pursued within a single industry or sector: one can speak for example of "a career in education", of "a criminal career" or of "a career in the building trade". A career has been defined by organizational behavior researchers as "an individual's work-related and other relevant experiences, both inside and outside of organizations, that form a unique pattern over the individual's life span." [3]
The word "career" ultimately derives from Latin carrus, referring to a chariot.[4] The semantic extension whereby "career" came to mean "course of one's public or professional life" appears from 1803.[5]
For a pre-modernist notion of "career", compare cursus honorum.

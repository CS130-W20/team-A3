That is, it is a subset of the Cartesian product X &#215; Y. It encodes the information of relation: an element x is related to an element y, if and only if the pair (x, y) belongs to the set. Binary relation is the most studied form of relations among all n-ary relations.[1]
An example of a binary relation is the "divides" relation over the set of prime numbers P and the set of integers Z, in which each prime p is related to each integer z that is a multiple of p, but not to an integer that is not a multiple of p. In this relation, for instance, the prime number 2 is related to numbers such as &#8722;4, 0, 6, 10, but not to 1 or 9, just as the prime number 3 is related to 0, 6, and 9, but not to 4 or 13.
Binary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model a wide variety of concepts. These include, among others:
A function may be defined as a special kind of binary relation.[2] Binary relations are also heavily used in computer science.

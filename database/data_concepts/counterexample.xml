<doc><id>counterexample</id><concept_name>counterexample</concept_name><wiki>In logic (especially in its applications to mathematics and philosophy), a counterexample is an exception to a proposed general rule or law, and often appears as an example which disproves a universal statement.[1][2] For example, the statement "all students are lazy" is a universal statement which makes the claim that a certain property (laziness) holds for all students. Thus, any student who is not lazy (e.g., hard-working) would constitute a counterexample to that statement. A counterexample hence is a specific instance of the falsity of a universal quantification (a "for all" statement).[3]
In mathematics, the term "counterexample" is also used (by a slight abuse) to refer to examples which illustrates the necessity of the full hypothesis of a theorem. This is most often done by considering a case where a part of the hypothesis is not satisfied, and where it can be shown that the conclusion of the theorem does not hold.[citation needed]
In mathematics, counterexamples are often used to prove the boundaries of possible theorems. By using counterexamples to show that certain conjectures are false, mathematical researchers can then avoid going down blind alleys and learn to modify conjectures to produce provable theorems. It is sometimes said that mathematical development consists primarily in finding (and proving) theorems and counterexamples.[4]
Suppose that a mathematician is studying geometry and shapes, and she wishes to prove certain theorems about them. She conjectures that "All rectangles are squares", and she is interested in knowing whether this statement is true or false.

<doc><id>Kavalan_language</id><concept_name>Kavalan language</concept_name><wiki>Kavalan (Kebalan/kbalan) was formerly spoken in the Northeast coast area of Taiwan by the Kavalan people (&#22134;&#29802;&#34349;). It is an East Formosan language of the Austronesian family.
Kavalan is no longer spoken in its original area.  As of 1930, it was used only as a home language.  As of 1987, it was still spoken in Atayal territories. In 2000, this language was still reported to be spoken by 24 speakers but considered moribund.
In 2017, a study using the EDGE metric from species conservation found that Kavalan, although critically endangered, was among the most lexically distinct of Austronesian languages.[4]
Kavalan consists of the following speech communities ordered from north to south (Li 2006:1):[5]

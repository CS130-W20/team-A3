<doc><id>derived_demand</id><concept_name>derived demand</concept_name><wiki>In economics, derived demand is demand for a factor of production or intermediate good that occurs as a result of the demand for another intermediate or final good.[1] In essence, the demand for, say, a factor of production by a firm is dependent on the demand by consumers for the product produced by the firm. The term was first introduced by Alfred Marshall in his Principles of Economics [2] in 1890.
This is similar to the concept of joint demand or complementary goods, the quantity consumed of one of them depending positively on the quantity of the other consumed.[1]
Producers have a derived demand for employees.  The employees themselves do not appear in the employer's utility function; rather, they enable employers to profit by fulfilling the demand by consumers for their product. Thus the demand for labour is a derived demand from the demand for goods and services.
For example, if the demand for a good such as wheat increases, then this leads to an increase in the demand for labour, as well as demand for other factors of production such as fertilizer.

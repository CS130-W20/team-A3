<doc><id>finite_impulse_response</id><concept_name>finite impulse response</concept_name><wiki>In signal processing, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is a filter whose impulse response (or response to any finite length input) is of finite duration, because it settles to zero in finite time. This is in contrast to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, which may have internal feedback and may continue to respond indefinitely (usually decaying).
The impulse response (that is, the output in response to a Kronecker delta input) of an Nth-order discrete-time FIR filter lasts exactly N&#160;+&#160;1 samples (from first nonzero element through last nonzero element) before it then settles to zero.
FIR filters can be discrete-time or continuous-time, and digital or analog.
For a causal discrete-time FIR filter of order N, each value of the output sequence is a weighted sum of the most recent input values:

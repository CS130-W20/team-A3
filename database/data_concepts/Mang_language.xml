It is spoken mainly in Lai Ch&#226;u Province, Vietnam and across the border in Jinping County, China. It was only recently discovered in 1974.
In China, the Mang people are also called Chaman &#23700;&#28385;, Abi &#38463;&#27604;, Mengga &#23391;&#22030;, Bageran &#24052;&#26684;&#28982;, and Mo &#33707; (Gao 2003:1).
In Lai Ch&#226;u Province, Vietnam, Mang is spoken by 2,200 people in the districts of S&#236;n H&#7891;, M&#432;&#7901;ng T&#232;, Phong Th&#7893;, and in other nearby areas (Gao 2003:1), including in N&#7853;m Ban Township, S&#236;n H&#7891; District, Lai Ch&#226;u Province.[3][4] In China, Mang speakers numbered 606 people in 1999.

<doc><id>ambrosia_software</id><concept_name>ambrosia software</concept_name><wiki>Ambrosia Software was a predominantly Macintosh software company founded in 1993 and located in Rochester, New York, U.S. Ambrosia Software was best known for its video games, but also published utility software. Its products were distributed as shareware; demo versions could be downloaded and used for up to 30 days. The company also released some products for iOS. Ambrosia's best-selling program was the utility Snapz Pro X,[1] according to a 2002 interview with company president Andrew Welch.
In 2017, customers reported on Ambrosia's Facebook page that attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful and they were unable to make new purchases.[2] As of July 2019, the website is offline.
Ambrosia Software was incorporated August 18, 1993 by Andrew Welch after he graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1992.[3]
The first game produced by Ambrosia was Maelstrom, a 1992 remake of the 1979 Asteroids arcade game.  Maelstrom won a number of software awards.[4] This initial success led Ambrosia to release several more arcade-style games, including  Apeiron (a remake of Centipede), Swoop (a clone of Galaxian), and Barrack (a clone of JezzBall). In 1999, Cameron Crotty of Macworld wrote "No other company has gotten so much mileage out of renovating mid-1980s arcade hits."[5]
Nearly all of the company's ten employees were laid off in 2013, but Welch denied rumors of the company shutting down.[6]

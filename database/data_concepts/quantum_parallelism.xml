A quantum computer is used to perform such computation, which can be implemented theoretically or physically[1]:I-5 There are two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer currently, analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into quantum simulation, quantum annealing, and adiabatic quantum computation. Digital quantum computers use quantum logic gates to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or qubits.[1]:2&#8211;13
Qubits are fundamental to quantum computing and are somewhat analogous to bits in a classical computer. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 quantum state. But they can also be in a superposition of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the probabilities of the two outcomes depends on the quantum state they were in.
Quantum computing began in the early 1980s, when physicist Paul Benioff proposed a quantum mechanical model of the Turing machine.[2]&#160;Richard Feynman&#160;and&#160;Yuri Manin&#160;later suggested that a quantum computer had the potential to simulate things that a classical computer could not.[3][4]  In 1994, Peter Shor developed a quantum algorithm for factoring integers that had the potential to decrypt all secured communications.[5]
Despite ongoing experimental progress since the late 1990s, most researchers believe that "fault-tolerant quantum computing [is] still a rather distant dream".[6] On 23 October 2019, Google AI, in partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), published a paper in which they claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy.[7] While some have disputed this claim, it is still a significant milestone in the history of quantum computing.[8]

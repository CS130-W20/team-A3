<doc><id>tucows</id><concept_name>tucows</concept_name><wiki>Tucows Inc. is a publicly traded Internet services and telecommunications company, headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and incorporated in Pennsylvania, United States.[4] It is currently the second-largest domain registrar worldwide and operates OpenSRS, Enom, Ascio and Hover, platforms for domain owners and resellers. It continues to host its namesake directory of shareware and freeware software downloads. In 2012, Tucows launched Ting, a wireless service provider and fiber Internet provider.
The company was formed in Flint, Michigan, United States, in 1993. The Tucows logo was two cow heads, a play on the homophone "two cows".
Scott Swedorski, a Flint native, started working as a computer lab manager at Flint's Mott Community College in 1991.  By late 1992, Swedorski left Mott College to work at the Genessee County Library System as a system administrator for FALCON (Flint Area Library Cooperative Online Network) [5] and saw a need to bring shareware reviews to the public. In 1993 he formed TUCOWS (The Ultimate Collection Of Winsock Software[6]) leading all editorial, reviews, HTML programming and scripting.[7]
In the early 1990s, Tucows was hosted on university and public servers (much like Yahoo! and Google were in their early stages). TUCOWS' mission was to provide users with downloads of both freeware and trial versions of shareware.  Internet Direct, owned and operated by John Nemanic, Bill Campbell, and Colin Campbell, acquired Tucows in 1996.[6] STI Ventures acquired Tucows in 1999.[6]

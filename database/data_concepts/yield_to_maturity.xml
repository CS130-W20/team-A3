The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualized yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest);  thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 &#215; 1.05 = 1.1025 and 2 &#215; 5 = 10.[2]
The main underlying assumptions used concerning the traditional yield measures are:
As some bonds have different characteristics, there are some variants of YTM:
When the YTM is less than the (expected) yield of another investment, one might be tempted to swap the investments. Care should be taken to subtract any transaction costs, or taxes.

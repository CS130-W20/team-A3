Decision theory is closely related to the field of game theory[2] and is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists,
statisticians, psychologists, biologists,[3] political and other social scientists, philosophers,[4] and computer scientists.
Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of statistical and econometric methods.
Normative decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully rational. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ought to make decisions) is called decision analysis and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies, and software (decision support systems) to help people make better decisions.[5][6]

Future
Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to manufacture semiconductor devices, typically the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices used in the integrated circuit (IC) chips that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices. It is a multiple-step sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps (such as surface passivation, thermal oxidation, planar diffusion and junction isolation) during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer made of pure semiconducting material. Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications.
The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips ready for shipment, takes six to eight weeks and is performed in highly specialized facilities referred to as foundries or fabs.[1] In more advanced semiconductor devices, such as modern 14/10/7&#160;nm nodes, fabrication can take up to 15 weeks (about 4 months) with 11&#8211;13 weeks (3 to 4 months) being the industry average.[2] Production in advanced fabrication facilities is completely automated, and carried out in a hermetically sealed, nitrogen environment to improve yield (the proportion of microchips in a wafer that function correctly) with FOUPs and automated material handling systems taking care of the transport of wafers from machine to machine. All machinery as well as FOUPs contain an internal nitrogen atmosphere. The air inside the machinery and the FOUPs is usually kept cleaner than the surrounding air in the cleanroom. This internal atmosphere is known as a mini environment.[3] Fab's need for large amounts of liquid nitrogen arises from the need to maintain the nitrogen atmosphere inside production machinery and FOUPs, which are constantly purged with nitrogen.[4]

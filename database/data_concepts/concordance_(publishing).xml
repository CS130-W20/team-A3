Concordances have been compiled only for works of special importance, such as the Vedas,[1] Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare, James Joyce or classical Latin and Greek authors,[2] because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved in creating a concordance in the pre-computer era. 
Concordance are more than an index; they include additional material, such as commentary, definitions and topical cross-indexing, which makes producing them a labor-intensive process, even when assisted by computers.
In the precomputing era, search technology was unavailable, and a concordance offered readers of long works such as the Bible something comparable to search results for every word that they would have been likely to search for. Today, the ability to combine the result of queries concerning multiple terms (such as searching for words near other words) has reduced interest in concordance publishing. In addition, mathematical techniques such as latent semantic indexing have been proposed as a means of automatically identifying linguistic information based on word context.
A bilingual concordance is a concordance based on aligned parallel text.

The theory of graph minors began with Wagner's theorem that a graph is planar if and only if its minors include neither the complete graph K5 nor the complete bipartite graph K3,3.[1] The Robertson&#8211;Seymour theorem implies that an analogous forbidden minor characterization exists for every property of graphs that is preserved by deletions and edge contractions.[2]
For every fixed graph H, it is possible to test whether H is a minor of an input graph G in polynomial time;[3] together with the forbidden minor characterization this implies that every graph property preserved by deletions and contractions may be recognized in polynomial time.[4]
Other results and conjectures involving graph minors include the graph structure theorem, according to which the graphs that do not have H as a minor may be formed by gluing together simpler pieces, and Hadwiger's conjecture relating the inability to color a graph to the existence of a large complete graph as a minor of it. Important variants of graph minors include the topological minors and immersion minors.
An edge contraction is an operation which removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices it used to connect. An undirected graph H is a minor of another undirected graph G if a graph isomorphic to H can be obtained from G by contracting some edges, deleting some edges, and deleting some isolated vertices.  The order in which a sequence of such contractions and deletions is performed on G does not affect the resulting graph H.

The main difference between causal inference and inference of association is that the former analyzes the response of the effect variable when the cause is changed.[1][2] The science of why things occur is called etiology.  Causal inference is an example of causal reasoning.
Inferring the cause of something has been described as:
Epidemiological studies employ different epidemiological methods of collecting and measuring evidence of risk factors and effect and different ways of measuring association between the two. A hypothesis is formulated, and then tested with statistical methods. It is statistical inference that helps decide if data are due to chance, also called random variation, or indeed correlated and if so how strongly. However, correlation does not imply causation, so further methods must be used to infer causation.[citation needed]
Common frameworks for causal inference are structural equation modeling and the Rubin causal model.[citation needed]

It emerged in the late 1950s with the appearance of the ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60 programming languages,[1] with the latter including support for block structures. Contributing factors to its popularity and widespread acceptance, at first in academia and later among practitioners, include the discovery of what is now known as the structured program theorem in 1966,[2] and the publication of the influential "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" open letter in 1968 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra, who coined the term "structured programming".[3]
Structured programming is most frequently used with deviations that allow for clearer programs in some particular cases, such as when exception handling has to be performed.
Following the structured program theorem, all programs are seen as composed of control structures:

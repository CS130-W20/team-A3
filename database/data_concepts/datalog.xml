It is often used as a query language for deductive databases.  In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration, information extraction, networking, program analysis, security, and cloud computing.[1]
Its origins date back to the beginning of logic programming, but it became prominent as a separate area around 1977 when Herv&#233; Gallaire and Jack Minker organized a workshop on logic and databases.[2] David Maier is credited with coining the term Datalog.[3]
Unlike in Prolog, statements of a Datalog program can be stated in any order. Furthermore, Datalog queries on finite sets are guaranteed to terminate, so Datalog does not have Prolog's cut operator. This makes Datalog a fully declarative language.
In contrast to Prolog, Datalog

<doc><id>augmented_product</id><concept_name>augmented product</concept_name><wiki>In marketing, a whole product is a generic product (or core product) augmented by everything that is needed for the customer to have a compelling reason to buy.[1] The core product is the tangible product that the customer experiences. The whole product typically augments the core product with additional elements required for the product to have compelling value to a customer. For example, if a personal computer is the core product, then whole product would include software applications, training classes, peripheral devices (mouse, keyboard, printer, etc.), and internet service. Without these additional product components, the core product would not be very useful.
The concept of the whole product was first introduced by Regis McKenna.[2] Geoffrey Moore helped popularize the term in his bestseller "Crossing the Chasm".

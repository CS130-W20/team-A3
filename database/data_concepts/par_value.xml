<doc><id>par_value</id><concept_name>par value</concept_name><wiki>Par value, in finance and accounting, means stated value or face value. From this come the expressions at par (at the par value), over par (over par value) and under par (under par value).
A bond selling at par is priced at 100% of face value. Par can also refer to a bond's original issue value or its value upon redemption at maturity.
The par value of stock has no relation to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic.[when?] The par value of a share is the value stated in the corporate charter below which shares of that class cannot be sold upon initial offering; the issuing company promises not to issue further shares below par value, so investors can be confident that no one else will receive a more favorable issue price. Thus, par value is the nominal value of a security which is determined by the issuing company to be its minimum price.  This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today,[when?] where stock issuance prices must usually be published.  The par value of stock remains unchanged in a bonus stock issue but it changes in a stock split.
In accounting, the par value allows the company to put a de minimis value for the stock on the company's financial statement. Par value is also used to calculate legal capital or share capital.

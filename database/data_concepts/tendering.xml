<doc><id>tendering</id><concept_name>tendering</concept_name><wiki>A request for tenders (RFT) is a formal, structured invitation to suppliers to submit a bid to supply products or services. In the public sector an official fee is needed to fortify and secure the tender bid engagement/win documents, such a process may be required and determined in detail by law to ensure that such competition for the use of public funds is open, fair and free from bribery and nepotism.[citation needed] For example, a government may put a building project 'out to tender'; that is, publish an invitation for other parties to make a proposal for the building's construction, on the understanding that any competition for the relevant government contract must be conducted in response to the tender, no parties having the unfair advantage of separate, prior, closed-door negotiations for the contract.[citation needed] An evaluation team will go through the tenders and decide who will get the contract.[citation needed]
As a consequence of the scale of the tender process the majority of RFTs are published by the government sector, but companies in the infrastructure and utilities sectors may also publish RFTs.[citation needed]
RFTs may be distributed to potential bidders through a tender service, allowing businesses to receive and search live tenders from a range of public and private sources.[citation needed] These alerts are most commonly sent daily and can be filtered down by geographical area, or by business sector.[citation needed] Some tendering services even divide types of business very finely in their own way, by CPV (Common Procurement Vocabulary) codes.[citation needed] This enables a business to find RFTs specific to what that business can supply.[citation needed]
The closest equivalent to an RFT in the mainstream private sector is a request for proposal (RFP), which, since public money is not involved, typically has a less rigid structure.

An export in international trade is a good or service produced in one country that is bought by someone in another country. The seller of such goods and services is an exporter; the foreign buyer is an importer.[1]
Export of goods often requires the involvement of customs authorities. An export's reverse counterpart is an import.
Many manufacturing firms begin their global expansion as exporters and only later switched to another mode for serving a foreign market. Exporting refers to the sending of goods and services from their country of origin to a foreign country as part of an exchange.[2]

Information technology engineering involves an architectural approach for planning, analyzing, designing, and implementing applications. Information technology engineering has been defined by Steven M Davis as: "An integrated and evolutionary set of tasks and techniques that enhance business communication throughout an enterprise enabling it to develop people, procedures and systems to achieve its vision".[citation needed]
Information technology engineering has many purposes, including organization planning, business re-engineering, application development, information systems planning and systems re-engineering. Information engineering can be used to analyze, design, and implement data structures in an enterprise. The goal of information engineering is to allow for a business to improve the way it manages its resources such as capital, people, and information systems to achieve its business goals. The importance of information engineering and its concepts have increased rapidly with the growth of current technology. Information engineering assumes that logical data representations are stable, which is the opposite to the processes that use the data which constantly change. This allows for the logical data model which reflects and organization's ideas to be the basis for systems development.
Information technology engineering used to be known more commonly as information engineering; this changed in the early 21st century, and information engineering took on a new meaning.

<doc><id>geomatics</id><concept_name>geomatics</concept_name><wiki>Geomatics is defined in the ISO/TC 211 series of standards as the "discipline concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of geographic data or geographic information".[1] Under another definition, it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data".[2]
It includes geomatics engineering (and surveying engineering) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).
The term was proposed in French ("g&#233;omatique") at the end of the 1960s by scientist Bernard Dubuisson to reflect at the time recent changes in the jobs of surveyor and photogrammetrist.[3] The term was first employed in a French Ministry of Public Works memorandum dated 1st June 1971 instituting a "standing committee of geomatics" in the government.[4]
The term was popularised in English by French-Canadian surveyor Michel Paradis in a The little Geodesist that could article in 1981 and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the ] in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and that, in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.[5]
Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in land surveying, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), global-navigation satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Compass), photogrammetry, geophysics, geography, and related forms of earth mapping. The term was originally used in Canada, because it is similar in origin to both French and English,[clarification needed] but has since been adopted by the International Organization for Standardization, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the United States) have shown a preference for the term geospatial technology.[2][verification needed]

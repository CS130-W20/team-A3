Kazakh or Kazak (Latin: qazaqsha or qazaq tili, Cyrillic: &#1179;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;&#1179;&#1096;&#1072; or &#1179;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;&#1179; &#1090;&#1110;&#1083;&#1110;, Arabic: &#1602;&#1575;&#1586;&#1575;&#1602;&#1588;&#1575;&#8206; or &#1602;&#1575;&#1586;&#1575;&#1602; &#1578;&#1609;&#1604;&#1609;&#8206;, pronounced&#160;[q&#593;z&#593;q&#712;&#597;&#593;], [q&#593;&#712;z&#593;q t&#618;&#712;l&#618;]), is a Turkic language of the Kipchak branch spoken in Central Asia. It is closely related to Nogai, Kyrgyz and Karakalpak. Kazakh is the official language of Kazakhstan and a significant minority language in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang, China and in the Bayan-&#214;lgii Province of Mongolia. Kazakh is also spoken by many ethnic Kazakhs through the former Soviet Union (approximately 472,000 in Russia according to the 2010 Russian Census), Germany, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan.
Like other Turkic languages, Kazakh is an agglutinative language and it employs vowel harmony.
In October 2017, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev decreed that the government would transition from using Cyrillic to the Latin alphabet by 2025.[4] President Nazarbayev signed on February 19, 2018 an amendment to the decree of October 26, 2017 No. 569 "On translating the Kazakh alphabet from Cyrillic alphabet to the Latin script."[5] The amended alphabet uses &#10216;sh&#10217; and &#10216;ch&#10217; for the Kazakh sounds /&#597;/ and /t&#597;/, respectively and eliminates the use of apostrophes.[6]

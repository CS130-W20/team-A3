The use of random permutations is often fundamental to fields that use randomized algorithms such as coding theory, cryptography, and simulation.  A good example of a random permutation is the shuffling of a deck of cards:  this is ideally a random permutation of the 52 cards.
One method of generating a random permutation of a set of length n uniformly at random (i.e., each of the n! permutations is equally likely to appear) is to generate a sequence by taking a random number between 1 and n sequentially, ensuring that there is no repetition, and interpreting this sequence (x1, ..., xn) as the permutation
shown here in two-line notation.
This brute-force method will require occasional retries whenever the random number picked is a repeat of a number already selected.  This can be avoided if, on the ith step (when x1, ..., xi &#8722; 1 have already been chosen), one chooses a number j at random between 1 and n &#8722; i + 1 and sets xi equal to the jth largest of the unchosen numbers.

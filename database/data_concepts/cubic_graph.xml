<doc><id>cubic_graph</id><concept_name>cubic graph</concept_name><wiki>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a  cubic graph is a graph in which all vertices have degree three. In other words, a cubic graph is a 3-regular graph. Cubic graphs are also called trivalent graphs.
A bicubic graph is a cubic bipartite graph.
In 1932, Ronald M. Foster began collecting examples of cubic symmetric graphs, forming the start of the Foster census.[1] Many well-known individual graphs are cubic and symmetric, including the utility graph, the Petersen graph, the Heawood graph, the M&#246;bius&#8211;Kantor graph, the Pappus graph, the Desargues graph, the Nauru graph, the Coxeter graph, the Tutte&#8211;Coxeter graph, the Dyck graph, the Foster graph and the Biggs&#8211;Smith graph. W. T. Tutte classified the symmetric cubic graphs by the smallest integer number s such that each two oriented paths of length s can be mapped to each other by exactly one symmetry of the graph. He showed that s is at most 5, and provided examples of graphs with each possible value of s from 1 to 5.[2]
Semi-symmetric cubic graphs include the Gray graph (the smallest semi-symmetric cubic graph), the Ljubljana graph, and the Tutte 12-cage.

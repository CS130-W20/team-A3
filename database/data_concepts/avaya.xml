Avaya (/&#601;&#712;va&#618;.&#601;/) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, that specializes in business communications, specifically unified communications (UC), contact center (CC), and services.[4][5][6] Serving organizations at 220,000 customer locations worldwide,[6] Avaya is the largest pure-play UC and CC company, ranking No. 1 in CC and No. 2 in UC and collaboration. The company had FY17 revenues of $3.3 billion, 78% of which was attributed to software and services.
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&amp;T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Avaya was then spun off from Lucent as its own company in 2000 (Lucent would merge with Alcatel SA in 2006, becoming Alcatel-Lucent, in turn being purchased by Nokia in 2016). It remained a public company from 2000 to 2007, when it was purchased by private equity firms.

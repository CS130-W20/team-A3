<doc><id>Buyang_language</id><concept_name>Buyang language</concept_name><wiki>Buyang (Chinese: &#24067;&#22830;&#35821;) is a Kra language spoken in Guangnan and Funing counties, Yunnan Province, China by the Buyang people.[4] It is important to the reconstruction of the hypothetical macrofamily Austro-Tai as it retains the disyllabic roots characteristic of Austronesian languages. Examples are /mat&#603;&#769;/ "to die", /mat&#225;/ "eye", /qa&#240;&#249;/ "head", and /ma&#240;&#251;/ "eight". (See Austro-Tai for proposed connections.)
The Buyang language was only discovered in 1990 by Chinese linguist Liang Min. In 1999, a doctoral dissertation and book was published for Buyang. The book has also recently been translated into English.
Many speakers of Buyang are also fluent in Zhuang.[5]
The Buyang (&#24067;&#22830;) dialect cluster is spoken by a total of around 2,000 people living mostly in the Gula (&#35895;&#25289;) River valley of southeastern Yunnan Province, China. It is spoken in at least 8 villages[6] in Gula Township &#35895;&#25289;&#20065;, Funing County &#23500;&#23425;&#21439;, Wenshan Zhuang&#8211;Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China.

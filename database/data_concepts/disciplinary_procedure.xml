According to Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), discipline could include censure, fine, suspension, or expulsion.[1] The officers may be removed from their position, including the position of the chair. If an offense occurs in a meeting, the assembly, having witnessed it themselves, can vote on a punishment without the need for a trial.[2] The chair has no authority to impose a penalty or to order the offending member to be removed from the hall, but the assembly has that power.[2] Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure states that the power of discipline is within the assembly as a whole and not the presiding officer acting alone.[3]
A trial is required if the offense occurs outside a meeting and the organization's rules do not describe the disciplinary procedures.[4] The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure (TSC) states that in trials of disciplinary procedures, members should be given due notice and a fair hearing.[5] The trial could be held in a meeting of the organization or in a meeting of a committee appointed by the organization for such a purpose.[6]
Nonmembers of the body that is meeting have no rights.[7] Nonmembers may be removed by the chair acting alone.[7]

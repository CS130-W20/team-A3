It may be calculated as either EBIT or EBITDA divided by the total interest expense.

Interest Expense





{\displaystyle {\mbox{Times-Interest-Earned}}={\frac {\mbox{EBIT or EBITDA}}{\mbox{Interest Expense}}}}

When the interest coverage ratio is smaller than one, the company is not generating enough cash from its operations EBIT to meet its interest obligations. The Company would then have to either use cash on hand to make up the difference or borrow funds. Typically, it is a warning sign when interest coverage falls below 2.5x.
The times interest earned ratio indicates the extent of which earnings are available to meet interest payments.

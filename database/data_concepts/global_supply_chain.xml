<doc><id>global_supply_chain</id><concept_name>global supply chain</concept_name><wiki>In development studies, the global value chain (GVC)  describes the people and activities involved in the production of a good or service and its supply, distribution, and post-sales activities (also known as the supply chain) when activities must be coordinated across geographies. GVC is similar to Industry Level Value Chain but encompasses operations at the global level.
The concept of a value chain has been used to analyse international trade in global value chains and comprises &#8220;the full range of activities that are required to bring a product from its conception, through its design, its sourced raw materials and intermediate inputs, its marketing, its distribution and its support to the final consumer&#8221;.[1]
The first references to the GVC concept date from the mid-1990s and were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for developing countries that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, the pioneer in value chain analysis, Gary Gereffi, describes a process of almost &#8216;natural&#8217; learning and upgrading for the firms that joined GVCs.[2] This echoed the &#8216;export-led&#8217; discourse of the World Bank in the &#8216;East Asian Miracle&#8217; report based on the East Asian &#8216;Tigers&#8217; success.
This encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises (MNE) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.

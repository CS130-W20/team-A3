<doc><id>outsourcing</id><concept_name>outsourcing</concept_name><wiki>Outsourcing is an agreement in which one company hires another company to be responsible for a planned or existing activity that is or could be done internally,[1][2]
and sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another.
The term outsourcing, which came from the phrase outside resourcing, originated no later than 1981.[3][4][5] The concept, which The Economist says "made its presence felt since the time of the Second World War,"[6] often involves the contracting of a business process (e.g., payroll processing, claims processing), operational, and/or non-core functions, such as manufacturing, facility management, call center/call centre support).
Outsourcing is also the practice of handing over control of public services to private enterprises,[7] even if on a short-term limited basis.[8]
Outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting,[9] and sometimes includes offshoring (relocating a business function to a distant country)[10] or nearshoring (transferring a business process to a nearby country).

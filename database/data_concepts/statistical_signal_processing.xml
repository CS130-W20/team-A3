According to Alan V. Oppenheim and Ronald W. Schafer, the principles of signal processing can be found in the classical numerical analysis techniques of the 17th century. Oppenheim and Schafer further state that the digital refinement of these techniques can be found in the digital control systems of the 1940s and 1950s.[3]
In 1948, Claude Shannon wrote the influential paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" which was published in the Bell System Technical Journal.[4]&#160;The paper laid the groundwork for later development of information communication systems. Around the same time, methods of signal transmission were being rapidly developed, as a new type of signal emerged called processing signals.[5]
Electronic signal processing was revolutionized by the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor),[6] which was originally invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng in 1959.[7] MOS integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single-chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early 1970s,[8] and then the first single-chip digital signal processor (DSP) in 1979.[9][10]

<doc><id>Bai_language</id><concept_name>Bai language</concept_name><wiki>The Bai language (Bai: Baip&#8231;ngvp&#8231;zix; simplified Chinese: &#30333;&#35821;; traditional Chinese: &#30333;&#35486;; pinyin: B&#225;iy&#468;) is a language spoken in China, primarily in Yunnan province, by the Bai people. The language has over a million speakers and is divided into three or four main dialects. Bai syllables are always open, with a rich set of vowels and eight tones. The tones are divided into two groups with modal and non-modal (tense, harsh or breathy) phonation. There is a small amount of traditional literature written with Chinese characters, Bowen (&#20720;&#25991;), as well as a number of recent publications printed with a recently standardized system of romanisation using the Latin alphabet.
The origins of Bai have been obscured by intensive Chinese influence of an extended period. Different scholars have proposed that it is an early offshoot or sister language of Chinese, part of the Loloish branch or a separate group within the Sino-Tibetan family.
Xu and Zhao (1984) divided Bai into three dialects, which may actually be distinct languages: Jianchuan (Central), Dali (Southern), and Bijiang (Northern).[4] Bijiang County has since been renamed as Lushui County.[5] Jianchuan and Dali are closely related, and speakers are reported to be able to understand one another after living together for a month.
The more divergent Northern dialects are spoken by about 15,000 Laemae (l&#603;&#744;&#745;m&#603;&#744;&#745;, Lemei, Lama), a clan numbering about 50,000 people who are partly submerged within the Lisu.[6]
They are now designated as two languages by ISO 639-3:

Structural drawings are generally prepared by registered professional engineers, and based on information provided by architectural drawings. The structural drawings are primarily concerned with the load-carrying members of a structure. They outline the size and types of materials to be used, as well as the general demands for connections. They do not address architectural details like surface finishes, partition walls, or mechanical systems. The structural drawings communicate the design of the building's structure to the building authority for review. Structural drawings are also included with a proposed building's contract documents, which guide contractors in detailing, fabricating, and installing parts of the structure.[1]

The structural drawings set has different subsets: General Notes, Plans, Elevations, Sections, and Details

General Notes are part of structural drawings and they cover the codes used in design and the by-laws of the building. Typically there are no details on these drawings. Structural notes provide information regarding general material properties (steel or wood grade, concrete strength, etc)  or construction requirements (soil compaction, weld procedures, etc). The structural notes also provide information about design criteria (gravity , seismic, and wind loading).[2]

The structural plan drawings show the foundation, floor, and roof plan of the building. These plans provide information like size and location of the structural elements present in the respective plans.

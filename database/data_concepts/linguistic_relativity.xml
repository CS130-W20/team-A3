The hypothesis of linguistic relativity, part of relativism, also known as the Sapir&#8211;Whorf hypothesis /s&#601;&#716;p&#618;&#601;r &#712;hw&#596;&#720;rf/, or Whorfianism is a principle claiming that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition, and thus people's perceptions are relative to their spoken language. 
The principle is often defined in one of two versions: the strong hypothesis, which was held by some of the early linguists before World War II,[1] and the weak hypothesis, mostly held by some of the modern linguists.[1]

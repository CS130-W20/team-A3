As a sociological effect of these processes, the users of the standardized varieties come to believe that the standard language is inherently superior or consider it the linguistic baseline by which to judge other varieties of language.[8]
The standardization of a language is a continual process, because a language-in-use cannot be permanently standardized like the parts of a machine.[9] Typically, the standardization process includes efforts to stabilize the spelling of the prestige dialect, to codify usages and particular (denotative) meanings through formal grammars and dictionaries, and to encourage public acceptance of the codifications as intrinsically correct.[10][11] In that vein, a pluricentric language has interacting standard varieties;[12][13][14] examples are English, French, and Portuguese, German, Korean, and Serbo-Croatian, Spanish and Swedish, Armenian and Mandarin Chinese;[15][16] whereas monocentric languages, such as Russian and Japanese, have one standardized idiom.[17]
In Europe, a standardized written language is sometimes identified with the German word Schriftsprache (written language). The term literary language is occasionally used as a synonym for standard language, especially with respect to the Slavic languages,[18] a naming convention still prevalent in the linguistic traditions of Eastern Europe.[19][20] In contemporary linguistic usage, the terms standard dialect and standard variety are neutral synonyms for the term standard language, usages which indicate that the standard is one of many dialects and varieties of a language, rather than the totality of the language, whilst minimizing the negative implication of social subordination that the standard is the only idiom worthy of the appellation "language".[21][22]
The term standard language identifies a repertoire of broadly recognizable conventions in spoken and written communications used in a society and does not imply either a socially ideal idiom or a culturally superior form of speech.[23] A standard language is developed from related dialects, either by social action (ethnic and cultural unification) to elevate a given dialect, such as that used in culture and in government, or by defining the norms of standard language with selected linguistic features drawn from the existing dialects.[24][25] Typically, a standard language includes a relatively fixed orthography codified in grammars and normative dictionaries, and includes linguistic features drawn from an agreed-upon collection of exemplar texts from the literature, law, and religion of a society.[25] Whether grammars and dictionaries are created by the state or by private citizens (e.g. Webster's Dictionary), some users regard such linguistic codifications as authoritative for correcting the spoken and written forms of the language.[26] Consequently, the codified usage of speech and writing render the standard language as the more stable idiom of communication for a society than the purely spoken dialects; the codifications are also the bases for further linguistic development (Ausbau).[25] In the practices of broadcasting and of official communications, the standard functions as a normative reference for acceptable speech and writing. It also informs the version of the language taught to non-native learners.[27]

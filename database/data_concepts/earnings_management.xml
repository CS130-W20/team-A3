<doc><id>earnings_management</id><concept_name>earnings management</concept_name><wiki>Earnings management, in accounting, is the act of intentionally influencing the process of financial reporting to obtain some private gain.[1] Earnings management involves the alteration of financial reports to mislead stakeholders about the organization's underlying performance, or to "influence contractual outcomes that depend on reported accounting numbers."[2]
Earnings management has a negative effect on earnings quality,[3] and may weaken the credibility of financial reporting.[4] Furthermore, in a 1998 speech Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management "widespread".[5] Despite its pervasiveness, the complexity of accounting rules can make earnings management difficult for individual investors to detect.[6]
Earnings management is believed to be widespread. A 1990 report on earnings management situations stated that "short-term earnings are being managed in many, if not all companies",[3] and in a 1998 speech, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt called earnings management a "widespread, but too little-challenged custom".[5]  In a 2013 essay, Ray Ball, while opining that accounting research was not reliably documenting earnings management, wrote: "Of course earnings management goes on. [...] People have been tried and convicted."[7]
The SEC has criticized earnings management as having adverse consequences for financial reporting, and for masking "the true consequences of management's decisions".[5] It has called on standard-setters to make changes to accounting standards to improve financial statement transparency, and has called for increased oversight over the financial reporting process.[4] The SEC has also pressed charges against the management of firms involved in fraudulent earnings management.[8][9]

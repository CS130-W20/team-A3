For example, a deterministic Turing machine can solve more decision problems in space n log n than in space n. The somewhat weaker analogous theorems for time are the time hierarchy theorems.
The foundation for the hierarchy theorems lies in the intuition that
with either more time or more space comes the ability to compute more
functions (or decide more languages).  The hierarchy theorems are used
to demonstrate that the time and space complexity classes form a
hierarchy where classes with tighter bounds contain fewer languages
than those with more relaxed bounds.  Here we define and prove the
space hierarchy theorem.
The space hierarchy theorems rely on the concept of space-constructible functions. The deterministic and nondeterministic space hierarchy theorems state that for all space-constructible functions f(n),
where SPACE stands for either DSPACE or NSPACE, and o refers to the little o notation.

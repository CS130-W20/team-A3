<doc><id>learning_curve</id><concept_name>learning curve</concept_name><wiki>A learning curve is a graphical representation of how an increase in learning (measured on the vertical axis) comes from greater experience (the horizontal axis); or how the more someone (or something) performs a task, the better they get at it.[1]
The term learning curve is used in two main ways: where the same task is repeated in a series of trials, or where a body of knowledge is learned over time. Hermann Ebbinghaus first described the learning curve in 1885 in the field of the psychology of learning, although the name did not come into use until 1903.[2][3] In 1936 Theodore Paul Wright described the effect of learning on production costs in the aircraft industry.[4] This form, in which unit cost is plotted against total production, is sometimes called[by whom?] an experience curve.
The familiar expression "a steep learning curve" means that the activity is difficult to learn, although a learning curve with a steep start actually represents rapid progress.[5][6]
The first person to describe the learning curve  was Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885. His tests involved memorizing series of nonsense syllables, and recording the success over a number of trials. The translation does not use the term learning curve&#8212;but he presents diagrams of learning against trial number. He also notes that the score can decrease, or even oscillate.[6][7][8]

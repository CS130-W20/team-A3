OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as autosegmental phonology and linear phonology (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as underlying representations, and the outputs as their surface realizations.
In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky in 1991[1] which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.[2]
There are three basic components of the theory:
Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, Con. Part of language acquisition can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

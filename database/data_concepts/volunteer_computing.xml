<doc><id>volunteer_computing</id><concept_name>volunteer computing</concept_name><wiki>Volunteer computing is a type of distributed computing, "an arrangement in which people, so-called volunteers, provide computing resources to projects, which use the resources to do distributed computing and/or storage".[1] Thus, computer owners or users donate their computing resources (such as processing power and storage) to one or more "projects".
Volunteers are frequently members of the general public in the possession of their own personal computers with an Internet connection, but also organizations can act as volunteers and provide their computing resources.
Projects in this context are mostly science-related projects executed by universities or academia in general.[1]
The first volunteer computing project was the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, which was started in January 1996.[2] It was followed in 1997 by distributed.net. In 1997 and 1998, several academic research projects developed Java-based systems for volunteer computing; examples include Bayanihan,[3] Popcorn,[4] Superweb,[5] and Charlotte.[6]

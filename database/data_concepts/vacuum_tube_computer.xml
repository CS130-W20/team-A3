Although superseded by second generation, transistorized computers, vacuum tube computers continued to be built into the 1960s. These computers were mostly one-of-a-kind designs.
The use of cross-coupled vacuum tube amplifiers to produce a train of pulses was described by Eccles and Jordan in 1918. This circuit became the basis of the flip-flop, a circuit with two states that became the fundamental element of electronic binary digital computers. 
The Atanasoff&#8211;Berry computer, a prototype of which was first demonstrated in 1939, is now credited as the first vacuum tube computer.[1] However it was not a general-purpose computer being able to only solve a system of linear equations and it was also not very reliable. 
During World War II, special purpose vacuum tube digital computers such as Colossus were used to break German and Japanese ciphers. The military intelligence gathered by these systems was essential to the Allied war effort.

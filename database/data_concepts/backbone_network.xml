<doc><id>backbone_network</id><concept_name>backbone network</concept_name><wiki>A backbone or core is a part of computer network that interconnects various pieces of network, providing a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or subnetworks.[1] A backbone can tie together diverse networks in the same building, in different buildings in a campus environment, or over wide areas. Normally, the backbone's capacity is greater than the networks connected to it.[2]
A large corporation that has many locations may have a backbone network that ties all of the locations together, for example, if a server cluster needs to be accessed by different departments of a company that are located at different geographical locations. The pieces of the network connections (for example: ethernet, wireless) that bring these departments together is often mentioned as network backbone. Network congestion is often taken into consideration while designing backbones.[3][4]
One example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone.[5]
The theory, design principles, and first instantiation of the backbone network came from the telephone core network, when traffic was purely voice. The core network was the central part of a telecommunications network that provided various services to customers who were connected by the access network.  One of the main functions was to route telephone calls across the PSTN.

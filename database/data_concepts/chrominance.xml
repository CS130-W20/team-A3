<doc><id>chrominance</id><concept_name>chrominance</concept_name><wiki>Chrominance (chroma or C for short) is the signal used in video systems to convey the color information of the picture, separately from the accompanying luma signal (or Y for short). Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U&#160;=&#160;B&#8242;&#160;&#8722;&#160;Y&#8242; (blue&#160;&#8722;&#160;luma) and V&#160;=&#160;R&#8242;&#160;&#8722;&#160;Y&#8242; (red&#160;&#8722;&#160;luma).  Each of these difference components may have scale factors and offsets applied to it, as specified by the applicable video standard.  
In composite video signals, the U and V signals modulate a color subcarrier signal, and the result is referred to as the chrominance signal; the phase and amplitude of this modulated chrominance signal correspond approximately to the hue and saturation of the color.  In digital-video and still-image color spaces such as Y&#8242;CbCr, the luma and chrominance components are digital sample values.
Separating RGB color signals into luma and chrominance allows the bandwidth of each to be determined separately.  Typically, the chrominance bandwidth is reduced in analog composite video by reducing the bandwidth of a modulated color subcarrier, and in digital systems by chroma subsampling.
The idea of transmitting a color television signal with distinct luma and chrominance components originated with Georges Valensi, who patented the idea in 1938.[1] Valensi's patent application described:

<doc><id>simplex_algorithm</id><concept_name>simplex algorithm</concept_name><wiki>In mathematical optimization, Dantzig's simplex algorithm (or simplex method) is a popular algorithm for linear programming.[1]
The name of the algorithm is derived from the concept of a simplex and was suggested by T. S. Motzkin.[2] Simplices are not actually used in the method, but one interpretation of it is that it operates on simplicial cones, and these become proper simplices with an additional constraint.[3][4][5][6] The simplicial cones in question are the corners (i.e., the neighborhoods of the vertices) of a geometric object called a polytope. The shape of this polytope is defined by the constraints applied to the objective function.
The simplex algorithm operates on linear programs in the canonical form
with

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\,\dots ,\,x_{n})}

 the variables of the problem,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {c} =(c_{1},\,\dots ,\,c_{n})}

 the coefficients of the objective function,

 a p&#215;n matrix, and

 nonnegative constants (

{\displaystyle \forall j,b_{j}\geq 0\ }

). There is a straightforward process to convert any linear program into one in standard form, so using this form of linear programs results in no loss of generality.

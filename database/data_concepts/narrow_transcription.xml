The most common type of phonetic transcription uses a phonetic alphabet, such as the International Phonetic Alphabet.
The pronunciation of words in all languages changes over time [1]. However, their written forms (orthography) are often not modified to take account of such changes, and do not accurately represent the pronunciation.  Pronunciation can also vary greatly among dialects of a language. Standard orthography in some languages, such as English and Tibetan, is often irregular and makes it difficult to predict pronunciation from spelling. For example, the words bough and through do not rhyme in English even though their spellings might suggest otherwise. Other languages, such as Spanish and Italian have a more consistent (but still imperfect) relationship between orthography and pronunciation, while a few languages may claim to have a fully phonemic spelling system (phonemic orthography).
For most languages, phonetic transcription makes it possible to show  pronunciation with something much nearer to a one-to-one relationship between sound and symbol than is possible with the language&#8217;s orthography. Phonetic transcription allows one to step outside orthography, examine differences in pronunciation between dialects within a given language and identify changes in pronunciation that may take place over time.
A basic principle of phonetic transcription is that it should be applicable to all languages, and its symbols should denote the same phonetic properties whatever the language being transcribed.[2] It follows that a transcription devised for one individual language or group of languages is not a phonetic transcription but an orthography.

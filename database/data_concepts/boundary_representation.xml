A solid is represented as a collection of connected surface elements, the boundary between solid and non-solid.
Boundary representation of models are composed of two parts: topology and geometry (surfaces, curves and points).  The main topological items are: faces, edges and vertices.  A face is a bounded portion of a surface; an edge is a bounded piece of a curve and a vertex lies at a point.  Other elements are the shell (a set of connected faces), the loop (a circuit of edges bounding a face) and loop-edge links (also known as winged edge links or half-edges) which are used to create the edge circuits.  The edges are like the edges of a table, bounding a surface portion.[clarification needed]
Compared to the constructive solid geometry (CSG) representation, which uses only primitive objects and Boolean operations to combine them, boundary representation is more flexible and has a much richer operation set. In addition to the Boolean operations, B-rep has extrusion (or sweeping), chamfer, blending, drafting, shelling, tweaking and other operations which make use of these.
The basic method for BREP was developed independently in the early 1970s by both Ian C. Braid in Cambridge (for CAD) and Bruce G. Baumgart at Stanford (for computer vision).  Braid continued his work with the research solid modeller BUILD which was the forerunner of many research and commercial solid modelling systems.  Braid worked on the commercial systems ROMULUS, the forerunner of Parasolid, and on ACIS.  Parasolid and ACIS are the basis for many of today's commercial CAD systems.

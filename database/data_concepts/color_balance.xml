<doc><id>color_balance</id><concept_name>color balance</concept_name><wiki>In photography and image processing, color balance is the global adjustment of the intensities of the colors (typically red, green, and blue primary colors).  An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors &#8211; particularly neutral colors &#8211; correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called gray balance, neutral balance, or white balance.  Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for color correction. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than neutrals or to deliberately change them for effect.
Image data acquired by sensors &#8211; either film or electronic image sensors &#8211; must be transformed from the acquired values to new values that are appropriate for color reproduction or display.  Several aspects of the acquisition and display process make such color correction essential &#8211; including that the acquisition sensors do not match the sensors in the human eye, that the properties of the display medium must be accounted for, and that the ambient viewing conditions of the acquisition differ from the display viewing conditions.
The color balance operations in popular image editing applications usually operate directly on the red, green, and blue channel pixel values,[1][2] without respect to any color sensing or reproduction model.  In film photography, color balance is typically achieved by using color correction filters over the lights or on the camera lens.[3]
Sometimes the adjustment to keep neutrals neutral is called white balance, and the phrase color balance refers to the adjustment that in addition makes other colors in a displayed image appear to have the same general appearance as the colors in an original scene.[4] It is particularly important that neutral (gray, neutral, white) colors in a scene appear neutral in the reproduction.

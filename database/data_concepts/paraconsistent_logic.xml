Alternatively, paraconsistent logic is the subfield of logic that is concerned with studying and developing paraconsistent (or "inconsistency-tolerant") systems of logic.
Inconsistency-tolerant logics have been discussed since at least 1910 (and arguably much earlier, for example in the writings of Aristotle);[1] however, the term paraconsistent ("beside the consistent") was not coined until 1976, by the Peruvian philosopher Francisco Mir&#243; Quesada.[2]
In classical logic (as well as intuitionistic logic and most other logics), contradictions entail everything. This curious feature, known as the principle of explosion or ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet (Latin, "from a contradiction, anything follows")[3] can be expressed formally as
Which means: if P and its negation &#172;P are both assumed to be true, then P is assumed to be true, from which it follows that at least one of the claims P and some other (arbitrary) claim A is true. However, if we know that either P or A is true, and also that P is not true (that &#172;P is true) we can conclude that A, which could be anything, is true. Thus if a theory contains a single inconsistency, it is trivial&#8212;that is, it has every sentence as a theorem.

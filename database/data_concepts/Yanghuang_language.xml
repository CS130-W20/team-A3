It is spoken by the Yanghuang &#20335;&#20697; people, many of whom are officially classified as Maonan by the Chinese government.
The Yanghuang people called themselves ai&#745;ra&#720;u&#745;, except for the Yanghuang of Huishui County, Xiayou District &#19979;&#28216;&#22320;&#21306;, and Xiguan Shangmo &#35199;&#20851;&#19978;&#33707;, who called themselves ai&#745;th&#601;n&#743;&#741; (Bo 1997). According to the Guizhou Ethnic Gazetteer (2002:846),[3] their autonyms include ji&#331;&#744;zau&#744;&#742; (&#21360;&#32469;) and ai&#744;au&#744;&#742; (&#21710;&#32469;).
"Yanghuang" was mentioned in a Ming Dynasty record, the Dushi Fangyu Jiyao (&#35835;&#21490;&#26041;&#33286;&#32426;&#35201;).[3] According to it, "the Man people of Sizhou are Yanghuang, Gelao, Muyao (Mulao), and Miaozhi (Miaozi). (&#24605;&#24030;&#34542;&#33258;&#20335;&#20697;&#12289;&#20193;&#20332;&#12289;&#26408;&#29814;&#65288;&#32769;&#65289;&#12289;&#33495;&#36136;&#65288;&#23376;&#65289;&#25968;&#31181;&#12290;)
Bo (1997:138-139) lists three main dialects of Yanghuang.

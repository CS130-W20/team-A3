<doc><id>limit_order</id><concept_name>limit order</concept_name><wiki>An order is an instruction to buy or sell on a trading venue such as a stock market, bond market, commodity market, financial derivative market or cryptocurrency exchange. These instructions can be simple or complicated, and can be sent to either a broker or directly to a trading venue via direct market access. There are some standard instructions for such orders.
A market order is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at the current market prices.[1]  As long as there are willing sellers and buyers, market orders are filled. Market orders are used when certainty of execution is a priority over the price of execution.
A market order is the simplest of the order types. This order type does not allow any control over the price received. The order is filled at the best price available at the relevant time.  In fast-moving markets, the price paid or received may be quite different from the last price quoted before the order was entered.[2]
A market order may be split across multiple participants on the other side of the transaction, resulting in different prices for some of the shares. It is the most basic of all orders and therefore, they incur the lowest of commissions, from both online and traditional brokers.[3]

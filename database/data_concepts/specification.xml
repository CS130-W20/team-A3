There are different types of technical or engineering specifications (specs), and the term is used differently in different technical contexts. They often refer to particular documents, and/or particular information within them. The word specification is broadly defined as "to state explicitly or in detail" or "to be specific". 
A requirement specification is a documented requirement, or set of documented requirements, to be satisfied by a given material, design, product, service, etc.[2] It is a common early part of engineering design and product development processes, in many fields.
A functional specification is a kind of requirement specification, and may show functional block diagrams.[citation needed]

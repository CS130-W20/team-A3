That is, the inverse wavelet transform is the adjoint of the wavelet transform.
If this condition is weakened one may end up with biorthogonal wavelets.
The scaling function is a refinable function.
That is, it is a fractal functional equation, called the refinement equation (twin-scale relation or dilation equation):
where the sequence

{\displaystyle (a_{0},\dots ,a_{N-1})}

 of real numbers is called a scaling sequence or scaling mask.
The wavelet proper is obtained by a similar linear combination,

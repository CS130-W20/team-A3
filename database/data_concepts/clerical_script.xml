This legibility stems from the highly rectilinear structure, a feature shared with modern regular script (kaishu). In structure and rectilinearity, it is generally similar to the modern script; however, in contrast with the tall to square modern script, it tends to be square to wide, and often has a pronounced, wavelike flaring of isolated major strokes, especially a dominant rightward or downward diagonal stroke. Some structures are also archaic.
Clerical script is popularly but mistakenly thought to have developed or been invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script. The process of change between small seal script and clerical script is referred to as the Libian (lit: Clerical Change) (&#38584;&#35722;).[2]  There are also historical traditions dating to the H&#224;n dynasty which mistakenly attributed the creation of clerical script to the Q&#237;n dynasty and in particular to Ch&#233;ng Mi&#462;o, who was said to have invented it at the behest of Qin Shi Huang.[3] Another traditional account is that it was invented by government scribes, in particular those involved in the justice and penal systems.[4]
However, from written materials unearthed by archaeologists, it is now known that all stages of Chinese writing underwent periods of natural evolution, and none of them were inventions by one person; this is true of clerical script as well.[5] Furthermore, rather than being established by government scribes, it has been argued that clerical script was already in popular use, and the Q&#237;n dynasty use by scribes merely reflects this trend.[6]
Archaeological discoveries now clearly show that an immature form of clerical script ("proto-clerical") was already developing in the state of Q&#237;n during the Warring States period,[7] and into the early Western H&#224;n; this can be seen on a number of bamboo books unearthed recently.[8] Furthermore, the writing immediately preceding clerical script was not merely seal script alone; rather, there was a coexistence of seal script (the at-first dominant and formal style) alongside an increasingly popular but secondary form of "vulgar", "popular", or "common" writing, which was very roughly executed and which was generally rectilinear.[9] The popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread.[9] The structures and style of many of the characters executed in this vulgar writing were similar or even identical to their later clerical script counterparts,[10] leading some to conclude that proto-clerical (and therefore clerical) script evolved not from seal script but from the vulgar writing of Q&#237;n, which coexisted with seal script in Warring States to Q&#237;n dynasty.[11] The Q&#237;n bamboo script is a good example of this transition, having evolved from vulgar Q&#237;n writing and considered by some to constitute Q&#237;n clerical script.[12]

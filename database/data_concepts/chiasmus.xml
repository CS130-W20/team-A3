In rhetoric, chiasmus or, less commonly, chiasm (Latin term from Greek &#967;&#943;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#945;, "crossing", from the Greek &#967;&#953;&#940;&#950;&#969;, chi&#225;z&#333;, "to shape like the letter &#935;") is a "reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases or clauses &#8211; but no repetition of words".[1] Chiasmus should not be confused with a subtype of this scheme, antimetabole, which also involves a reversal of grammatical structures in successive phrases or clauses, but unlike chiasmus, presents a repetition of words in an A-B-B-A configuration.[2]
Chiasmus balances words or phrases with similar, though not identical, meanings: 
But O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves.
&#8212;Shakespeare, Othello 3.3

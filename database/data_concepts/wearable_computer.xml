A wearable computer, also known as a wearable or body-borne computer,[1][2] is a small computing device worn on the body.[3]
The definition of 'wearable computer' may be narrow or broad, extending to smartphones or even ordinary wristwatches.[4][5]
Wearables may be for general use, in which case they are just a particularly small example of mobile computing. Alternatively they may be for specialized purposes such as fitness trackers. They may incorporate special sensors such as accelerometers, thermometer and heart rate monitors, or novel user interfaces such as Google Glass, an optical head-mounted display controlled by gestures. It may be that specialized wearables will evolve into general all-in-one devices, as happened with the convergence of PDAs and mobile phones into smartphones.

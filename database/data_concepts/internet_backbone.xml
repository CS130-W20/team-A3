<doc><id>internet_backbone</id><concept_name>internet backbone</concept_name><wiki>The Internet backbone may be defined by the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected computer networks and core routers on the Internet. 
These data routes are hosted by commercial, government, academic and other high-capacity network centers, the Internet exchange points and network access points, that exchange Internet traffic between the countries, continents and across the oceans. Internet service providers, often Tier 1 networks, participate in Internet backbone traffic by privately negotiated interconnection agreements, primarily governed by the principle of settlement-free peering.
The Internet, and consequently its backbone networks, do not rely on central control or coordinating facilities, nor do they implement any global network policies. The resilience of the Internet results from its principal architectural features, most notably the idea of placing as few network state and control functions as possible in the network elements, and instead relying on the endpoints of communication to handle most of the processing to ensure data integrity, reliability, and authentication. In addition, the high degree of redundancy of today's network links and sophisticated real-time routing protocols provide alternate paths of communications for load balancing and congestion avoidance.
The largest providers, known as tier&#160;1 providers, have such comprehensive networks that they never purchase transit agreements from other providers.[1] As of 2019 there are six tier&#160;1 providers in the telecommunications industry, which are: CenturyLink (Level 3), Telia Carrier, NTT, GTT, Tata Communications, and Telecom Italia.[2]

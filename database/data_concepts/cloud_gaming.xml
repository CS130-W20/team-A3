<doc><id>cloud_gaming</id><concept_name>cloud gaming</concept_name><wiki>Cloud gaming, sometimes called gaming on demand, is a type of online gaming that runs games on remote servers and streams them directly to a user&#8217;s device, or more colloquially, playing a game remotely from a cloud.[1][2] The three prominent types of cloud gaming are peer-to-peer gaming, game streaming, and progressive downloading.[3][4] In 2019, Google&#8217;s announcement of Stadia increased public attention to the potential of cloud gaming and helped launch it into gaming media.
Currently, there are three types of consumer services that are frequently referred to as &#8220;cloud gaming:&#8221; Game streaming, peer-to-peer gaming, and progressive downloading.
In game streaming, the service most commonly referred to as &#8220;cloud gaming,&#8221; a user consumes the game content through a thin client.
Game streaming is a type of online gaming that allows direct and on-demand video streaming of games onto computers, consoles, and mobile devices, similar to video on demand, through the use of a thin client. The actual game is stored, executed, and rendered on the remote operator's or game company's server and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer's computers over the internet.[5] This allows access to games without the need of a console and largely makes the capability of the user's computer unimportant, as the server is the system that is running the processing needs.[6][7] The controls and button presses from the user are transmitted directly to the server, where they are recorded, and the server then sends back the game's response to the input controls.

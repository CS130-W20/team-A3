Graph theory itself is typically dated as beginning with Leonhard Euler's 1736 work on the Seven Bridges of K&#246;nigsberg. However, drawings of complete bipartite graphs were already printed as early as 1669, in connection with an edition of the works of Ramon Llull edited by Athanasius Kircher.[3][4] Llull himself had made similar drawings of complete graphs three centuries earlier.[3]
A complete bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two subsets V1 and V2 such that no edge has both endpoints in the same subset, and every possible edge that could connect vertices in different subsets is part of the graph. That is, it is a bipartite graph (V1, V2, E) such that for every two vertices v1 &#8712; V1 and v2 &#8712; V2, v1v2 is an edge in E. A complete bipartite graph with partitions of size |V1|=m and |V2|=n, is denoted Km,n;[1][2] every two graphs with the same notation are isomorphic.

Although less common, wire bonding can be used to connect an IC to other electronics or to connect from one printed circuit board (PCB) to another. Wire bonding is generally considered the most cost-effective and flexible interconnect technology and is used to assemble the vast majority of semiconductor packages. Wire bonding can be used at frequencies above 100&#160;GHz.[1]
Bondwires usually consist of one of the following materials:
Wire diameters start at 15 &#956;m and can be up to several hundred micrometres for high-powered applications.
The wire bonding industry is transitioning from gold to copper.[2][3][4] This change has been instigated by the rising cost of gold and the comparatively stable, and much lower, cost of copper. While possessing higher thermal and electrical conductivity than gold, copper had previously been seen as less reliable due to its hardness and susceptibility to corrosion. By 2015, it is expected that more than a third of all wire bonding machines in use will be set up for copper.[5]

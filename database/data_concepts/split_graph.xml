Split graphs were first studied by F&#246;ldes and  Hammer&#160;(1977a, 1977b), and independently introduced by Tyshkevich and Chernyak&#160;(1979).[1]
A split graph may have more than one partition into a clique and an independent set; for instance, the path a&#8211;b&#8211;c is a split graph, the vertices of which can be partitioned in three different ways:
Split graphs can be characterized in terms of their forbidden induced subgraphs: a graph is split if and only if no induced subgraph is a cycle on four or five vertices, or a pair of disjoint edges (the complement of a 4-cycle).[2]
From the definition, split graphs are clearly closed under complementation.[3] Another characterization of split graphs involves complementation: they are chordal graphs the complements of which are also chordal.[4] Just as chordal graphs are the intersection graphs of subtrees of trees, split graphs are the intersection graphs of distinct substars of star graphs.[5] Almost all chordal graphs are split graphs; that is, in the limit as n goes to infinity, the fraction of n-vertex chordal graphs that are split approaches one.[6]

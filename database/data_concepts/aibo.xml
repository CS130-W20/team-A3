<doc><id>aibo</id><concept_name>aibo</concept_name><wiki>AIBO (stylized aibo, Artificial Intelligence Robot, homonymous with aib&#333; (&#30456;&#26834;), "pal" or "partner" in Japanese) is a series of robotic pets designed and manufactured by Sony. Sony announced a prototype Aibo in mid-1998.[1] The first consumer model was introduced on 11 May 1999.[2] New models were released every year until 2006. Although most models were dog-like, other inspirations included lion-cubs and space explorer, and only the ERS-7 version and ERS-1000 versions was explicitly a "robotic dog".[3]
In 2006, AIBO was added into the Carnegie Mellon University Robot Hall of Fame.[4]
On 26 January 2006 Sony announced that it would discontinue AIBO and several other products in an effort to make the company more profitable.[5] Sony's AIBO customer support was withdrawn gradually, with support for the final ERS-7M3 ending in March 2013.[6]
In July 2014, Sony stopped providing repairs for AIBO products and did not provide customer support or repair for AIBO robots.[7]

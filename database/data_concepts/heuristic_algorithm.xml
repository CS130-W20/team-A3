<doc><id>heuristic_algorithm</id><concept_name>heuristic algorithm</concept_name><wiki>In computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematical optimization, a heuristic (from Greek &#949;&#8017;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#954;&#969; "I find, discover") is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution.  This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed.  In a way, it can be considered a shortcut.
A heuristic function, also called simply a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[1]
The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand.  This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time.
Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values).

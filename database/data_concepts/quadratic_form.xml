is a quadratic form in the variables x and y. The coefficients usually belong to a fixed field K, such as the real or complex numbers, and we speak of a quadratic form over K.
Quadratic forms occupy a central place in various branches of mathematics, including number theory, linear algebra, group theory (orthogonal group), differential geometry (Riemannian metric, second fundamental form), differential topology (intersection forms of four-manifolds), and Lie theory (the Killing form).
Quadratic forms are not to be confused with a quadratic equation which has only one variable and includes terms of degree two or less. A quadratic form is one case of the more general concept of homogeneous polynomials.

The learning material is in a kind of textbook or teaching machine or computer. The medium presents the material in a logical and tested sequence. The text is in small steps or larger chunks. After each step, learners are given a question to test their comprehension. Then immediately the correct answer is shown. This means the learner at all stages makes responses, and is given immediate knowledge of results.[2][3]
Anticipating programmed learning, Edward L. Thorndike wrote in 1912:
Thorndike, however, did nothing with his idea. The first such system was devised by Sidney L. Pressey in 1926.[6][7] "The first... [teaching machine] was developed by Sidney L. Pressey... While originally developed as a self-scoring machine... [it] demonstrated its ability to actually teach."[8]

Although the term font first referred to a set of movable metal type pieces in one style and size, since the 1990s it is generally used to refer to a set of digital shapes in a single style, scalable to different sizes. A font family or typeface refers to the collection of related fonts across styles and sizes.
There are three basic kinds of computer font file data formats:
Bitmap fonts are faster and easier to use in computer code, but non-scalable, requiring a separate font for each size.[1] Outline and stroke fonts can be resized using a single font and substituting different measurements for components of each glyph, but are somewhat more complicated to render on screen than bitmap fonts, as they require additional computer code to render the outline to a bitmap for display on screen or in print. Although all types are still in use, most fonts seen and used on computers are outline fonts.
Fonts are designed and created using font editors. Fonts specifically designed for the computer screen and not printing are known as screen fonts.

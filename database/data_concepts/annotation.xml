It can be a note that includes a comment or explanation.[1] Annotations are sometimes presented in the margin of book pages.
Textual scholarship is a discipline that often uses the technique of annotation to describe or add additional historical context to texts and physical documents.[2]
Students often highlight passages in books in order to refer back to key phrases easily, or add marginalia to aid studying. 
Annotated bibliographies add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.

A lingua franca (/&#716;l&#618;&#331;&#609;w&#601; &#712;fr&#230;&#331;k&#601;/ (listen); lit.&#8201;Frankish tongue; for plurals see &#167;&#160;Usage notes),[1] also known as a bridge language, common language, trade language, auxiliary language, vehicular language, or link language, is a language or dialect systematically used to make communication possible between groups of people who do not share a native language or dialect, particularly when it is a third language that is distinct from both of the speakers' native languages.[2]
Lingua francas have developed around the world throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called "trade languages" facilitated trade), but also for cultural, religious, diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities.[3][4] The term is taken from the medieval Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a Romance-based pidgin language used (especially by traders and seamen) as a lingua franca in the Mediterranean Basin from the 11th to the 19th century. A world language &#8211; a language spoken internationally and by many people &#8211; is a language that may function as a global lingua franca.
Lingua franca refers to any language used for communication between people who do not share a native language.[5] It can refer to mixed languages such as pidgins and creoles used for communication between language groups. It can also refer to languages which are native to one nation (often a colonial power) but used as a second language for communication between diverse language communities in a colony or former colony.[6] Lingua franca is a functional term, independent of any linguistic history or language structure.[7]

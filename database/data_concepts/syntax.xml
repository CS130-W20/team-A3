The term syntax is also used to refer to the study of such principles and processes.[3] The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the syntactic rules common to all languages.
The word syntax comes from Ancient Greek: &#963;&#973;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#953;&#962; "coordination", which consists of &#963;&#973;&#957; syn, "together", and &#964;&#940;&#958;&#953;&#962; t&#225;xis, "an ordering".
One basic description of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence SVO or the sequence SOV. The other possible sequences are VSO, VOS, OVS, and OSV, the last three of which are rare. In most generative theories of syntax, these surface differences arise from a more complex clausal phrase structure, and each order may be compatible with multiple derivations.
The A&#7779;&#7789;&#257;dhy&#257;y&#299; of P&#257;&#7751;ini (c. 4th century BC in Ancient India),  is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory (as works on grammar were written long before modern syntax came about).[4] In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of Dionysius Thrax.

<doc><id>syllogism</id><concept_name>syllogism</concept_name><wiki>A syllogism (Greek: &#963;&#965;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#963;&#956;&#972;&#962; syllogismos, "conclusion, inference") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true.
In a form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced. For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form:
All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
In antiquity, two rival theories of the syllogism existed: Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic syllogistic.[1] Aristotle defines the syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so".[2] Despite this very general definition, in Prior Analytics Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions.[3] These include categorical modal syllogisms.[4]

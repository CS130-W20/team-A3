A similar script is used today by the Xibe people, who speak a language considered either as a dialect of Manchu or a closely related, mutually intelligible language. It is written vertically from top to bottom, with columns proceeding from left to right.
According to the Veritable Records&#160;[zh] (Manchu: &#6190;&#6176;&#6184;&#6197;&#6240;&#8239;&#6259;&#6198;&#6176;&#6261;&#6244;&#6259;&#6198;&#6176;&#6184;&#6260;&#6179;&#6179;&#6191;&#6259;;&#8194;M&#246;llendorff: manju i yargiyan kooli; Chinese: &#28415;&#27954;&#23526;&#37636;; pinyin: M&#462;nzh&#333;u Sh&#237;l&#249;), in 1599 the Jurchen leader Nurhaci decided to convert the Mongolian alphabet to make it suitable for the Manchu people. He decried the fact that while illiterate Han Chinese and Mongolians could understand their respective languages when read aloud, that was not the case for the Manchus, whose documents were recorded by Mongolian scribes. Overriding the objections of two advisors named Erdeni and G'ag'ai, he is credited with adapting the Mongolian script to Manchu. The resulting script was known as tongki fuka ak&#363; hergen (Manchu: &#6248;&#6179;&#6185;&#6260;&#6259;&#6262;&#6240;&#6260;&#6176;&#6176;&#6260;&#6241;&#6245;&#6237;&#6261;&#6244;&#6237;&#6184;) &#8212; the "script without dots and circles".
In 1632, Dahai added diacritical marks to clear up a lot of the ambiguity present in the original Mongolian script; for instance, a leading k, g, and h are distinguished by the placement of no diacritical mark, a dot, and a circle, respectively. This revision created the standard script, known as tongki fuka sindaha hergen (Manchu: &#6248;&#6179;&#6185;&#6260;&#6259;&#6262;&#6240;&#6260;&#6176;&#6192;&#6259;&#6184;&#6249;&#6176;&#6245;&#6176;&#6245;&#6237;&#6261;&#6244;&#6237;&#6184;) &#8212; the "script with dots and circles". As a result, the Manchu alphabet contains little ambiguity. Recently discovered manuscripts from the 1620s make clear, however, that the addition of dots and circles to Manchu script began before their supposed introduction by Dahai.
Dahai also added the tulergi hergen ("foreign/outer letters"): ten graphemes to facilitate Manchu to be used to write Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan loanwords. Previously, these non-Manchu sounds did not have corresponding letters in Manchu.[1]
Sounds that were transliterated included the aspirated sounds k' (Chinese pinyin: k, &#6202;), k (g, &#6252;), x (h, &#6253;); ts' (c, &#6254;); ts (ci, &#6254;&#6154;&#6239;); sy (si, &#6192;&#6154;&#6239;); dz (z, &#6255;); c'y (chi, &#6257;&#6239;); j'y (zhi, &#6263;&#6239;); and &#382; (r, &#6256;).[2]

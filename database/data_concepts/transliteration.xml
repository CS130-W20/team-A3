<doc><id>transliteration</id><concept_name>transliteration</concept_name><wiki>Transliteration is a type of conversion of a text from one script to another that involves swapping letters (thus trans- + liter-) in predictable ways (such as &#945; &#8594; a, &#1076; &#8594; d, &#967; &#8594; ch, &#1398; &#8594; n or &#230; &#8594; ae).
For instance, for the Modern Greek term "&#917;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942; &#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;", which is usually translated as "Hellenic Republic", the usual transliteration to Latin script is "Ell&#275;nik&#7703; D&#275;mokrat&#237;a", and the name for Russia in Cyrillic script, "&#1056;&#1086;&#1089;&#1089;&#1080;&#1103;", is usually transliterated as "Rossiya".
Transliteration is not primarily concerned with representing the sounds of the original but rather with representing the characters, ideally accurately and unambiguously. Thus, in the above example, &#955;&#955; is transliterated as 'll', but pronounced /l/; &#916; is transliterated as 'D', but pronounced /&#240;/; and &#951; is transliterated as '&#275;', though it is pronounced /i/ (exactly like &#953;) and is not long.
Conversely, transcription notes the sounds but not necessarily the spelling. So "&#917;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#942; &#916;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#945;" could be transcribed as "elinik&#237; &#240;imokrat&#237;a", which does not specify which of the /i/ sounds are written as &#951; and which as &#953;.

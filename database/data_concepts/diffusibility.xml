<doc><id>diffusibility</id><concept_name>diffusibility</concept_name><wiki>Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atom, ions, molecules) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is driven by a gradient in concentration.
The concept of diffusion is widely used in many fields, including physics (particle diffusion), chemistry, biology, sociology, economics, and finance (diffusion of people, ideas, and price values). The central idea of diffusion, however, is common to all of these: an object (for example, atom, idea, etc.) undergoing diffusion spreads out from a point or location at which there is a higher concentration of that object.
A gradient is the change in the value of a quantity, for example, concentration, pressure, or temperature with the change in another variable, usually distance. A change in concentration over a distance is called a concentration gradient, a change in pressure over a distance is called a pressure gradient, and a change in temperature over a distance is called a temperature gradient.
The word diffusion derives from the Latin word, diffundere, which means "to spread  out."

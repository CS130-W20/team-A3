The kernel market currently is dominated by Parasolid and ACIS, which were introduced in the late 1980s. The latest kernels to enter the market are C3D, developed in 1995, and Convergence Geometric Modeler, developed in 1998; they were introduced as standalone products in 2013 and 2011 perspectively. ShapeManager has no presence in the kernel licensing market and in 2001 Autodesk clearly stated they were not going into this business.
The world's newest geometric modeling kernel is Russian Geometric Kernel owned by the Russian government, and it is not clear if it is going to be commercially available. However, it has superior features over the other kernels on the market.[20][21][22][23]
In the table below you can see a representative list of developers that belong to companies developing their own kernel or licensing the kernel from third-party[24]

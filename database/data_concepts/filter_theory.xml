The purpose is to find a realization of the filter that meets each of the requirements to a sufficient degree to make it useful.
The filter design process can be described as an optimization problem where each requirement contributes to an error function which should be minimized.  Certain parts of the design process can be automated, but normally an experienced electrical engineer is needed to get a good result.
Typical requirements which are considered in the design process are:
An important parameter is the required frequency response.
In particular, the steepness and complexity of the response curve is a deciding factor for the filter order and feasibility.

They are larger and have more processing power than some other classes of computers: minicomputers, servers, workstations, and personal computers.
The term originally referred to the large cabinets called "main frames" that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers.[2][3] Later, the term was used to distinguish high-end commercial machines from less powerful units.[4] Most large-scale computer system architectures were established in the 1960s, but continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used as servers.
Modern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by:
Their high stability and reliability enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time, with mean time between failures (MTBF) measured in decades.

Amplifiers included in a filter design can be used to improve the cost, performance and predictability of a filter.[1]
An amplifier prevents the load impedance of the following stage from affecting the characteristics of the filter. An active filter can have complex poles and zeros without using a bulky or expensive inductor.  The shape of the response, the Q (quality factor), and the tuned frequency can often be set with inexpensive variable resistors.[2] In some active filter circuits, one parameter can be adjusted without affecting the others.[1]
Using active elements has some limitations.  Basic filter design equations neglect the finite bandwidth of amplifiers. Available active devices have limited bandwidth, so they are often impractical at high frequencies. Amplifiers consume power and inject noise into a system. Certain circuit topologies may be impractical if no DC path is provided for bias current to the amplifier elements. Power handling capability is limited by the amplifier stages.[3]

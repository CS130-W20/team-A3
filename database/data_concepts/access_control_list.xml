<doc><id>access_control_list</id><concept_name>access control list</concept_name><wiki>An access-control list (ACL), with respect to a computer file system, is a list of permissions attached to an object.  An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to objects, as well as what operations are allowed on given objects.[1] Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.  For instance, if a file object has an ACL that contains (Alice: read,write; Bob: read), this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and Bob to only read it.
Many kinds of operating systems implement ACLs, or have a historical implementation.
A filesystem ACL is a data structure (usually a table) containing entries that specify individual user or group rights to specific system objects such as programs, processes, or files. These entries are known as access-control entries (ACEs) in the Microsoft Windows NT,[2] OpenVMS, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Each accessible object contains an identifier to its ACL. The privileges or permissions determine specific access rights, such as whether a user can read from, write to, or execute an object. In some implementations, an ACE can control whether or not a user, or group of users, may alter the ACL on an object. 
POSIX 1003.1e/1003.2c working group made an effort to standardize ACLs, resulting in what is now known as "POSIX.1e ACL" or simply "POSIX ACL".[3] The POSIX.1e/POSIX.2c drafts were withdrawn in 1997 due to participants losing interest for funding the project and turning to more powerful alternatives such as NFSv4 ACL.[4] As of December&#160;2019[update], no live sources of the draft could be found on the Internet, but it can still be found in the Internet Archive.[5]

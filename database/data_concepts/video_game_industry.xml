The video game industry is the economic sector involved in the development, marketing, and monetization of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.[1]
The video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream.[citation needed] They took in about US$9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in[update] 2010 (ESA annual report).
Modern personal computers owe many advances and innovations to the game industry: sound cards, graphics cards and 3D graphic accelerators, faster CPUs, and dedicated co-processors like PhysX are a few of the more notable improvements.

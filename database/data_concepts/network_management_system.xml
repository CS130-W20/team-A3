Network monitoring is part of network management.
While an intrusion detection system monitors a network threats from the outside, a network monitoring system monitors the network for problems caused by overloaded or crashed servers, network connections or other devices.
For example, to determine the status of a web server, monitoring software may periodically send an HTTP request to fetch a page. For email servers, a test message might be sent through SMTP and retrieved by IMAP or POP3.
Commonly measured metrics are response time, availability and uptime, although both consistency and reliability metrics are starting to gain popularity. The widespread addition of WAN optimization devices is having an adverse effect on most network monitoring tools, especially when it comes to measuring accurate end-to-end delay because they limit round-trip delay time visibility.[1]

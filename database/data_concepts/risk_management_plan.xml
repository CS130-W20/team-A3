A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project's objectives."[1] Risk is inherent with any project, and project managers should assess risks continually and develop plans to address them.  The risk management plan contains an analysis of likely risks with both high and low impact, as well as mitigation strategies to help the project avoid being derailed should common problems arise.  Risk management plans should be periodically reviewed by the project team to avoid having the analysis become stale and not reflective of actual potential project risks.
Most critically, risk management plans include a risk strategy.
Broadly, there are four potential responses to risk with numerous variations on the specific terms used to name these response options:[2][3]

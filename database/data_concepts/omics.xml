<doc><id>omics</id><concept_name>omics</concept_name><wiki>The English-language neologism omics informally refers to a field of study in biology ending in  -omics, such as genomics, proteomics or metabolomics. Omics aims at the collective characterization and quantification of pools of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism or organisms.
The related suffix -ome is used to address the objects of study of such fields, such as the genome, proteome or metabolome respectively. The suffix -ome as used in molecular biology refers to a totality of some sort; it is an example of a "neo-suffix" formed by abstraction from various Greek terms in  -&#969;&#956;&#945;, a sequence that does not form an identifiable suffix in Greek.
Functional genomics aims at identifying the functions of as many genes as possible of a given organism. It combines
different -omics techniques such as transcriptomics and proteomics with saturated mutant collections.[1]
The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) distinguishes three different fields of application for the -ome suffix:

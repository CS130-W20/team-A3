There are other notions of compactness in mathematics; also, the term "finite" in its normal set theoretic meaning does not coincide with the order-theoretic notion of a "finite element".
In a partially ordered set (P,&#8804;) an element c is called compact (or finite) if it satisfies one of the following equivalent conditions:
If the poset P additionally is a join-semilattice (i.e., if it has binary suprema) then these conditions are equivalent to the following statement:

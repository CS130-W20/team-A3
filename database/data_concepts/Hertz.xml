The hertz (symbol: Hz) is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second.[1] It is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, the first person to provide conclusive proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz are commonly expressed in multiples: kilohertz (103 Hz, kHz), megahertz (106 Hz, MHz), gigahertz (109 Hz, GHz), terahertz (1012 Hz, THz), petahertz (1015 Hz, PHz),  exahertz (1018 Hz, EHz),
and zettahertz (1021 Hz, ZHz).
Some of the unit's most common uses are in the description of sine waves and musical tones, particularly those used in radio- and audio-related applications. It is also used to describe the clock speeds at which computers and other electronics are driven. The units are sometimes also used as a representation of energy, via the photon energy equation (E=h&#957;), with one hertz equivalent to h joules.
The hertz is defined as one cycle per second. The International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second as "the duration of 9&#160;192&#160;631&#160;770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom"[2][3] and then adds: "It follows that the hyperfine splitting in the ground state of the caesium 133 atom is exactly 9&#160;192&#160;631&#160;770 hertz, &#957;(hfs Cs) = 9&#160;192&#160;631&#160;770 Hz." The dimension of the unit hertz is 1/time (1/T). Expressed in base SI units it is 1/second (1/s).

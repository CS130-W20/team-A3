The other language spoken within the same community is Western Yughur, which is a Turkic language. The terms may also indicate the speakers of these languages. Traditionally, both languages are indicated by the term Yellow Uygur, from the autonym of the Yugur. Eastern Yugur speakers are said to have passive bilingualism with Southern Mongolian, the standard spoken in China.[3]
Grigory Potanin recorded a glossary of Salar, Western Yugur, and Eastern Yugur in his 1893 book written in Russian, The Tangut-Tibetan Borderlands of China and Central Mongolia.[4][5][6][7][8][9]
The phonemes /&#231;, &#231;&#688;, &#597;, &#597;&#688;, &#642;, &#657;/ appear exclusively in Chinese loanwords.[10]

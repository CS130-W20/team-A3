<doc><id>Shixing_language</id><concept_name>Shixing language</concept_name><wiki>Shixing, also rendered Shuhi, is a poorly-attested Qiangic language of Sichuan and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Two thirds of its speakers are monolingual.
Shixing is also known by its Chinese name Xumi (&#26093;&#31859; X&#249;m&#464;); it is spoken by about 1800 people living by the Shuiluo River &#27700;&#27931; in Shuiluo Township &#27700;&#27931;&#20065;, Mili Tibetan Autonomous County.[3]
Katia Chirkova reports two varieties.[4]
Xumi features a very unusual phonemic contrast between voiceless /&#654;&#805;/ and voiced /&#654;/ alveolo-palatal lateral approximants.[5][6]

<doc><id>network_game</id><concept_name>network game</concept_name><wiki>A multiplayer video game is a video game in which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time, either locally (e.g. New Super Mario Bros.) or online over the internet (e.g. World of Warcraft, Call of Duty). Multiplayer games usually require players to share the resources of a single game system or use networking technology to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work cooperatively with a human partner to achieve a common goal, supervise other players' activity, co-op. Multiplayer games allow players interaction with other individuals in partnership, competition or rivalry, providing them with social communication absent from single-player games.
During its early history, video games were often single-player-only activities, putting the player against pre-programmed challenges or AI-controlled opponents, which lacked human creativity.
Asynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have to be playing at the same time.[1]
Some of the earliest video games were two-player games, including early sports games (such as 1958's Tennis For Two  and 1972's Pong), early shooter games such as Spacewar! (1962)[2] and early racing video games such as Astro Race (1973).[3] The first examples of multiplayer real-time games were developed on the PLATO system about 1973. Multi-user games developed on this system included 1973's Empire and 1974's Spasim; the latter was an early first-person shooter. Other early video games included turn-based multiplayer modes, popular in tabletop arcade machines. In such games, play is alternated at some point (often after the loss of a life). All players' scores are often displayed onscreen so players can see their relative standing.

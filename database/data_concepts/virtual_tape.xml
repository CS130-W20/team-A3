<doc><id>virtual_tape</id><concept_name>virtual tape</concept_name><wiki>A virtual tape library (VTL) is a data storage virtualization technology used typically for backup and recovery purposes.  A VTL presents a storage component (usually hard disk storage) as tape libraries or tape drives for use with existing backup software.
Virtualizing the disk storage as tape allows integration of VTLs with existing backup software and existing backup and recovery processes and policies.  The benefits of such virtualization include storage consolidation and faster data restore processes. For most mainframe data centers, the storage capacity varies, however protecting its business and mission critical data is always vital.
Most current VTL solutions use SAS or SATA disk arrays as the primary storage component due to their relatively low cost. The use of array enclosures increases the scalability of the solution by allowing the addition of more disk drives and enclosures to increase the storage capacity.
The shift to VTL also eliminates streaming problems that often impair efficiency in tape drives as disk technology does not rely on streaming and can write effectively regardless of data transfer speeds.

<doc><id>trusted_computing</id><concept_name>trusted computing</concept_name><wiki>Trusted Computing (TC) is a technology developed and promoted by the Trusted Computing Group.[1] The term is taken from the field of trusted systems and has a specialized meaning. With Trusted Computing, the computer will consistently behave in expected ways, and those behaviors will be enforced by computer hardware and software.[1] Enforcing this behavior is achieved by loading the hardware with a unique encryption key inaccessible to the rest of the system.
TC is controversial as the hardware is not only secured for its owner, but also secured against its owner. Such controversy has led opponents of trusted computing, such as free software activist Richard Stallman, to refer to it instead as treacherous computing,[2] even to the point where some scholarly articles have begun to place scare quotes around "trusted computing".[3][4]
Trusted Computing proponents such as International Data Corporation,[5] the Enterprise Strategy Group[6] and Endpoint Technologies Associates[7] claim the technology will make computers safer, less prone to viruses and malware, and thus more reliable from an end-user perspective. They also claim that Trusted Computing will allow computers and servers to offer improved computer security over that which is currently available. Opponents often claim this technology will be used primarily to enforce digital rights management policies and not to increase computer security.[2][8]:23
Chip manufacturers Intel and AMD, hardware manufacturers such as HP and Dell, and operating system providers such as Microsoft include Trusted Computing in their products if enabled.[9][10] The U.S. Army requires that every new PC it purchases comes with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).[11][12] As of July 3, 2007, so does virtually the entire United States Department of Defense.[13]

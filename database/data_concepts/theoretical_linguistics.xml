Linguistic metalanguage, theories, methodology, and the construction of analytical models of language are part of theoretical linguistics.[1] Theoretical linguistics is situated between descriptive linguistics and language philosophy.
While the basic linguistic terminology is shared by most or all, different approaches to linguistic research have developed their own terminology. Various frameworks of linguistic inquiry may also understand same terms in different ways, depending on which theory of language they support.

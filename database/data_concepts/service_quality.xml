<doc><id>service_quality</id><concept_name>service quality</concept_name><wiki>Service quality (SQ), in its contemporary conceptualisation, is a comparison of perceived expectations (E) of a service with perceived performance (P), giving rise to the equation SQ=P-E.[1] This conceptualistion of service quality has its origins in the expectancy-disconfirmation paradigm.[2]
A business with high service quality will meet or exceed customer expectations whilst remaining economically competitive.[3] Evidence from empirical studies suggests that improved service quality increases profitability and long term economic competitiveness. Improvements to service quality may be achieved by improving operational processes; identifying problems quickly and systematically; establishing valid and reliable service performance measures and measuring customer satisfaction and other performance outcomes.[4]
From the viewpoint of business administration, service quality is an achievement in customer service.[5]  It reflects at each service encounter. Customers form service expectations from past experiences, word of mouth and marketing communications.[6] In general, customers compare perceived service with expected service, and if the former falls short of the latter the customers are disappointed.
For example, in the case of Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, wherein TAJ remaining the old world, luxury brand in the five-star category, the umbrella branding was diluting the image of the TAJ brand because although the different hotels such as Vivanta by Taj- the four star category, Gateway in the three star category and Ginger the two star economy brand, were positioned and categorised differently, customers still expected high quality of Taj.

<doc><id>procedure-oriented_language</id><concept_name>procedure-oriented language</concept_name><wiki>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,[citation needed] based on the concept of the procedure call.  Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.  Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages appeared circa 1957&#8211;1964, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL, PL/I and BASIC.[1] Pascal and C were published circa 1970&#8211;1972.
Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful (for example Lisp machines or Java processors).[contradictory]
Modularity is generally desirable, especially in large, complicated programs. Inputs are usually specified syntactically in the form of arguments and the outputs delivered as return values.
Scoping is another technique that helps keep procedures modular.  It prevents the procedure from accessing the variables of other procedures (and vice versa), including previous instances of itself, without explicit authorization.

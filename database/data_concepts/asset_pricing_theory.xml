In financial economics, asset pricing refers to a formal treatment and development of two main pricing principles, [1] outlined below, together with the resultant models. 
There have been many models developed for different situations, but correspondingly, these stem from general equilibrium asset pricing or rational asset pricing[2], the latter corresponding to risk neutral pricing.
Investment theory, which is near synonymous, encompasses the body of knowledge used to support the decision-making process of choosing investments,[3] and the asset pricing models are then applied in determining the asset-specific required rate of return on the investment in question, or in pricing derivatives on these, for trading or hedging.
Under General equilibrium theory prices are determined through market pricing by supply and demand.  Here asset prices jointly satisfy the requirement that the quantities of each asset supplied and the quantities demanded must be equal at that price - so called market clearing.  These models are born out of modern portfolio theory, with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) as the prototypical result.

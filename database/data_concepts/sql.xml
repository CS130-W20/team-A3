It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.
SQL offers two main advantages over older read&#8211;write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index.
Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[8] which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL),[a] a data definition language (DDL),[b] a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML).[c][9] The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it includes also procedural elements.
SQL was one of the first commercial languages to utilize Edgar F. Codd&#8217;s relational model. The model was described in his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[10]  Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.[11][12]

<doc><id>Paiwan_language</id><concept_name>Paiwan language</concept_name><wiki>Paiwan is a native language of Taiwan, spoken by the Paiwan, a Taiwanese indigenous people. Paiwan is a Formosan language of the Austronesian language family. It is also one of the national languages of Taiwan.[2] The number of speakers is estimated to be 66,000.[4]
Paiwan variants can be divided into the following dialect zones (Ferrell 1982:4&#8211;6).
This classification were though be corrected by Cheng 2016 as below:
Note: A village unnoted of Vuculj/Ravar is by default placed under Vuculj here. 
Kuljaljau Paiwan has 23&#8211;24 consonants (/h/ is found only in loanwords, and /&#660;/ is uncommon) and 4 vowels (Ferrell 1982:7). Unlike many other Formosan languages that have merged many Proto-Austronesian phonemes, Paiwan preserves most Proto-Austronesian phonemes and is thus highly important for reconstruction purposes.

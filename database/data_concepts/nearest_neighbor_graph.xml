In many discussions the directions of the edges are ignored and the NNG is defined as an ordinary (undirected) graph. However, the nearest neighbor relation is not a symmetric one, i.e., p from the definition is not necessarily a nearest neighbor for q.
In some discussions, in order to make the nearest neighbor for each object unique, the set P is indexed and in the case of a tie the object with, e.g., the largest index is taken for the nearest neighbor.[2]
The k-nearest neighbor graph (k-NNG) is a graph in which two vertices p and q are connected by an edge, if the distance between p and  q is among the k-th smallest distances from p to other objects from P. The NNG is a special case of the k-NNG, namely it is the 1-NNG. k-NNGs obey a separator theorem: they can be partitioned into two subgraphs of at most n(d + 1)/(d + 2) vertices each by the removal of O(k1/dn1&#160;&#8722;&#160;1/d) points.[3]

<doc><id>magic_set</id><concept_name>magic set</concept_name><wiki>A magic set or magic kit is a kind of toy, usually directed at younger children, which includes materials and instructions to perform some simple magic tricks. The tricks included often rely heavily on gimmicked props, and require little skill to perform.[1] In addition to providing props for various tricks, these sets will often contain instructions for many more, elevating the number of tricks that can be advertised.[1] Sets directed at adults, known as "executive" magic sets, often have higher-quality materials and more complex tricks.[1][2]

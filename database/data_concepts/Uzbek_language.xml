<doc><id>Uzbek_language</id><concept_name>Uzbek language</concept_name><wiki>Uzbek is a Turkic language that is the first official and only declared national language of Uzbekistan. The language of Uzbeks, it is spoken by some 27 million native speakers in Uzbekistan and elsewhere in Central Asia (2015), making it the second-most widely spoken Turkic language after Turkish.
Uzbek belongs to the Eastern Turkic or Karluk, branch of the Turkic language family. External influences include Arabic, Persian and Russian. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel /&#593;/ to /&#594;/, a feature that was influenced by Persian. Standard Uzbek is also notable for its complete loss of vowel harmony, a characteristic Turkic feature.
In the language itself, Uzbek is o&#699;zbek tili or o&#699;zbekcha.  In Cyrillic, it is &#1118;&#1079;&#1073;&#1077;&#1082; &#1090;&#1080;&#1083;&#1080; or &#1118;&#1079;&#1073;&#1077;&#1082;&#1095;&#1072;. In Arabic script, &#1575;&#1608;&#1586;&#1576;&#1740;&#1705; &#1578;&#1740;&#1604;&#1740;&#8206; and &#1575;&#1608;&#1586;&#1576;&#1740;&#1705;&#1670;&#1607;&#8206;.
Turkic speakers probably settled the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Zarafshan river basins from at least 600&#8211;700 CE, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of Eastern Iranian languages who previously inhabited Sogdia, Bactria and Khwarezm. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 9th&#8211;12th centuries,[5] who were a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yaghma and other tribes.[6]

In electronic design, a netlist is a description of the connectivity of an electronic circuit.[1][2] In its simplest form, a netlist consists of a list of the electronic components in a circuit and a list of the nodes they are connected to.[1][3] A network (net) is a collection of two or more interconnected components.
The structure, complexity and representation of netlists can vary considerably, but the fundamental purpose of every netlist is to convey connectivity information. Netlists usually provide nothing more than instances, nodes, and perhaps some attributes of the components involved.[4] If they express much more than this, they are usually considered to be a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL, or one of several languages specifically designed for input to simulators.
Netlists can be physical or logical, instance-based or net-based, and flat or hierarchical. The latter can be either folded or unfolded.

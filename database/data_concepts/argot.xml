<doc><id>argot</id><concept_name>argot</concept_name><wiki>A cant, cryptolect, argot, anti-language  or secret language is the jargon or language of a group, often employed to exclude or mislead people outside the group.[1] Each term differs slightly in meaning, and their use is inconsistent.
There are two main schools of thought on the origin of the word cant:
An argot (English:  /&#712;&#593;&#720;r&#609;o&#650;/; from French argot [a&#641;&#712;&#609;o] 'slang') is a secret language used by various groups to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term argot is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which sense it overlaps with jargon. 
In his 1862 novel Les Mis&#233;rables, Victor Hugo refers to that argot as both "the language of the dark" and "the language of misery."[4]

Similar to the Suite Vollard completed in 2001 in Brazil,[6] each floor is designed to rotate independently,[3] resulting in a changing shape of the tower. Each floor is designed to rotate a maximum of 6 metres (20&#160;ft) per minute, or one full rotation in 180 minutes.[1][3]
It was proposed as the world's first prefabricated skyscraper with 40 factory-built modules for each floor.[1][7] Fisher said that 90% of the tower could be built in a factory and shipped to the construction site.[1] This would allow the entire building to be built more quickly.[5] The core of the tower must be built at the construction site.[1] Fisher said that the prefabricated portions would decrease the project's cost and the number of workers,[8] and that construction will take 30% less time than a normal skyscraper of the same size.[9] The majority of the workers would be in factories, working under safer conditions.[9] Kitchen and bathroom fixtures would be pre-installed. The core would serve each floor with a special, patented connection for clean water, based on technology used to refuel airplanes in mid-flight.[7]
The entire tower is proposed to be powered from wind turbines and solar panels. Enough surplus electricity should be produced to power five other similar sized buildings in the vicinity.[4]  The turbines would be located between each of the rotating floors.[10] Fisher said that they could generate up to 1,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy each year. The solar panels are expected to cover the roof and the top of each floor.[4][9][10]

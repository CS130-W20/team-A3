<doc><id>opera_software</id><concept_name>opera software</concept_name><wiki>Opera Software AS is a Norwegian software company, primarily known for its desktop Opera web browser, and its mobile counterpart Opera Mini. It was demerged from its parent company Otello Corporation as part of the latter's divestiture of its web browser business. Opera browsers have more than 350 million users worldwide across multiple platforms.[4]
Opera is also involved in promoting Web standards through participation in the W3C. The company has its headquarters in Oslo, Norway and also has offices in Sweden, Poland, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Russia, Ukraine, Iceland, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States.[5]
The company changed ownership when Otello (at the time, Opera Software ASA) sold its web-browser and consumer businesses along with the Opera brand to a Chinese group of investors in 2016, with the deal completing in November of that year.[6]
On July 27, 2018, Opera Software went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $115 million in its initial public offering.[7]

<doc><id>attribute_grammars</id><concept_name>attribute grammars</concept_name><wiki>An attribute grammar is a formal way to define attributes for the productions of a formal grammar, associating these attributes with values. The evaluation occurs in the nodes of the abstract syntax tree, when the language is processed by some parser or compiler.
The attributes are divided into two groups: synthesized attributes and inherited attributes. The synthesized attributes are the result of the attribute evaluation rules, and may also use the values of the inherited attributes. The inherited attributes are passed down from parent nodes.
In some approaches, synthesized attributes are used to pass semantic information up the parse tree, while inherited attributes help pass semantic information down and across it. For instance, when constructing a language translation tool, such as a compiler, it may be used to assign semantic values to syntax constructions. Also, it is possible to validate semantic checks associated with a grammar, representing the rules of a language not explicitly imparted by the syntax definition.
Attribute grammars can also be used to translate the syntax tree directly into code for some specific machine, or into some intermediate language.

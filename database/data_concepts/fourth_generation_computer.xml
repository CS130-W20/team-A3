By 1959, discrete transistors were considered sufficiently reliable and economical that they made further vacuum tube computers uncompetitive. Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) large-scale integration (LSI) technology subsequently led to the development of semiconductor memory in the mid-to-late 1960s and then the microprocessor in the early 1970s. This led to primary computer memory moving away from magnetic-core memory devices to solid-state static and dynamic semiconductor memory, which greatly reduced the cost, size and power consumption of computers. These advances led to the miniaturized personal computer (PC) in the 1970s, starting with home computers and desktop computers, followed by laptops and then mobile computers over the next several decades.
The mass increase in the use of computers accelerated with 'Third Generation' computers. These generally relied on integrated circuit (microchip) technology, starting around 1966 in the commercial market. 
In 1958, Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments invented the hybrid integrated circuit (hybrid IC),[1] which had external wire connections, making it difficult to mass-produce.[2] In 1959, Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor invented the monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip.[3][2] It was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium. This basis for Noyce's monolithic IC was Fairchild's planar process, which allowed integrated circuits to be laid out using the same principles as those of printed circuits. The planar process was developed by Noyce's colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959, based on the silicon surface passivation and thermal oxidation processes developed by Mohamed M. Atalla at Bell Labs in the late 1950s.[4][5][6]
Computers using IC chips began to appear in the early 1960s. For example, the 1961 Semiconductor Network Computer (Molecular Electronic Computer, Mol-E-Com),[7][8][9] first monolithic integrated circuit[10][11][12] general purpose computer (built for demonstration purposes, programmed to simulate a desk calculator) was built by Texas Instruments for the US Air Force.[13][14][15]

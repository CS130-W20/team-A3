In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated .mw-parser-output span.smallcaps{font-variant:small-caps}.mw-parser-output span.smallcaps-smaller{font-size:85%}adj) is a word that modifies a noun or noun phrase or describes its referent. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.
Adjectives are one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns.[1] Certain words that were traditionally considered to be adjectives, including the, this, my, etc., are today usually classed separately, as determiners.
Adjective comes from Latin n&#333;men adject&#299;vum,[2] a calque of Ancient Greek: &#7952;&#960;&#943;&#952;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#8004;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;, romanized:&#160;ep&#237;theton &#243;noma, lit.&#160;'additional noun'.[3][4] In the grammatical tradition of Latin and Greek, because adjectives were inflected for gender, number, and case like nouns (a process called declension), they were considered a type of noun. The words that are today typically called nouns were then called substantive nouns (n&#333;men substant&#299;vum).[5] The terms noun substantive and noun adjective were formerly used in English but are now obsolete.[1]

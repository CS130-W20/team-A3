<doc><id>segment_tree</id><concept_name>segment tree</concept_name><wiki>In computer science, a segment tree, also known as a statistic tree, is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain a given point. It is, in principle, a static structure; that is, it's a structure that cannot be modified once it's built.  A similar data structure is the interval tree.
A segment tree for a set I of n intervals uses O(n log n) storage and can be built in O(n log n) time. Segment trees support searching for all the intervals that contain a query point in O(log n + k), k being the number of retrieved intervals or segments.[1]
Applications of the segment tree are in the areas of computational geometry, and geographic information systems.
The segment tree can be generalized to higher dimension spaces.

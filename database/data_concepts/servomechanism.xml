The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed or other parameters.[3] For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls position&#8212;the operator does this by observation. By contrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.
A common type of servo provides position control. Commonly, servos are electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic. They operate on the principle of negative feedback, where the control input is compared to the actual position of the mechanical system as measured by some type of transducer at the output. Any difference between the actual and wanted values (an "error signal") is amplified (and converted) and used to drive the system in the direction necessary to reduce or eliminate the error.  This procedure is one widely used application of control theory. Typical servos can give a rotary (angular) or linear output.
Speed control via a governor is another type of servomechanism. The steam engine uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of water wheels. Prior to World War II the constant speed propeller was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. Fuel controls for gas turbine engines employ either hydromechanical or electronic governing.
